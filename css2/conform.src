<H1 align="center">Conformance: requirements and recommendations</H1>

<H2>Definitions</H2>

<p> In this section, we begin the formal specification of CSS2,
starting with the contract between authors, documents, users, and user
agents. 

<P>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./refs.html#ref-RFC2119" class="normref">[RFC2119]</a>.  However, for
readability, these words do not appear in all upper case letters in
this specification.

<P>At times, the authors of this specification recommend good practice
for authors and user agents.  These recommendations are not normative
and conformance with this specification does not depend on their
realization. These recommendations contain the expression "We
recommend ...", "This specification recommends ...", or some similar
wording.

<dl>
<dt><dfn><strong>Style sheet</strong></dfn>
<dd>A set of statements that specify
presentation of a document. 

<P>Style sheets may have three different origins: <a
href="#author">author</a>, <a href="#user">user</a>, and <a
href="#user-agent">user agent</a>. The interaction of these sources is
described in the section on <a href="cascade.html">cascading and
inheritance</a>.

<dt><dfn><strong><a name="valid-style-sheet">Valid style sheet</a></strong></dfn></dt>
<dd>The <span class="index-def" title="valid style sheet">validity</span>
of a style sheet depends on the level of CSS used for the style sheet.

<P>All style sheets of level N-1 are valid level N style sheets. Thus,
all CSS1 style sheets are valid CSS2 style sheets.

<P>A valid CSS2 style sheet must respect the <a
href="grammar.html">grammar of CSS2</a> and the <a
href="selector.html">selector syntax</a>. Furthermore, it must only
contain at-rules, property names, and property values defined in this
specification.

<dt><dfn><strong>Source document</strong></dfn>
<dd>The document to which one or more style sheets refer.

<dt><dfn><strong><a name="doclanguage">Document language</a></strong></dfn>
<dd>The computer language of the source 
document (e.g., HTML, XML, etc.).

<P>The primary syntactic constructs of the document language are
called <span class="index-def"
title="element"><em>elements,</em></span> (an SGML term, see <a
rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-ISO8879"
class="normref">[ISO8879]</a>). Most CSS style sheet rules refer to
these elements and specify rendering information for them.  Examples
of elements in HTML include "P" (for structuring paragraphs), "TABLE"
(for creating tables), "OL" (for creating ordered lists), etc.

<P><span class="index-def" title="block-level element"><em>Block-level
elements</em></span> are those elements of the document language that,
by default, are formatted visually as blocks (e.g., paragraphs).
<span class="index-def" title="inline element"><em>Inline
elements</em></span> are those elements of the document language that
do not cause paragraph breaks (e.g., pieces of text, inline images,
etc.)

<dt><dfn><strong><a name="author">Author</a></strong></dfn>
<dd>An author is a person or program that
writes or generates style sheets.

<dt><dfn><strong><a name="user">User</a></strong></dfn> 
<dd>A user is a person who interacts with a user agent to view, hear,
or otherwise use a document and its associated style sheets.

<dt><dfn><strong>User agent</strong></dfn>
<dd>A <span class="index-def" title="user agent|UA"><em>user
agent</em></span> is any program that interprets a document written in
the document language and applies associated style sheets by according
to the terms of this specification. A user agent may display a
document, read it aloud, cause it to be printed, convert it
to another format, etc.

<dt><dfn><strong>Conforming user agent</strong></dfn>
<dd>
<p><em>This section defines <span class="index-def"
title="conformance"><em>conformance</em></span> with the CSS2
specification only. There may be other levels of CSS in the future
that may require a UA to implement a different set of features in
order to conform.</em></P>

<P>In general, the following points must be observed by user agents
claiming conformance to this specification:</P>

<ol>
<li>It must define the <a href="media.html">media types</a> it
supports in terms of CSS media types.
<li>For each source document, it must retrieve all 
associated style sheets that are appropriate for the supported media
types.
<li>It must parse the style sheets according to this specification.
In particular, it must recognize all at-rules, blocks, declarations,
and selectors (see the <a href="grammar.html">grammar of CSS2</a>).
If a user agent encounters a property relative to a supported
medium, the user agent must parse the value according to the property
definition. This means that the user agent must accept all legal
values and must reject other values. User agents may skip values of
properties relative to unsupported <a href="media.html">media
types</a>.
<li>Given a <a href="#doctree">document tree</a>, it must
assign a value for every supported property according to
the rules of <a href="cascade.html">cascading and inheritance</a>.
</ol>

<P>Not every user agent must observe every point, however:

<ul>
<li>A user agent that only <em>inputs</em> style sheets must
only respect points 1 - 3.

<li>A user agent that only <em>outputs</em> style sheets is only required
to output <a href="#valid-style-sheet">valid style sheets</a>

<li>A user agent that <em>renders</em> a document with associated style
sheets must respect points 1 - 4 and render the document
according to the media-specific requirements set forth in this
specification.
</ul>

<P>The inability of a user agent to implement part of this
specification due to the limitations of a particular device (e.g., a
user agent cannot render colors on a monochrome monitor or a black and
white page) does not imply non-conformance. </P>

<p>This specification also recommends that a UA offer the following
functionality to the user (these do not refer to any specific
user interface):

<UL>
 <LI>Allow the user to specify user style sheets
 <LI>Allow the user to turn on or off specific style sheets .
 <LI>Approximate style sheet values even if it can't implement
     them in strict accordance with this specification.
</UL>

<P>Different user interface paradigms may have their own constraints:
a VR browser may rescale the document based on its "distance" from the
user.</P>

<P> UAs may offer readers additional choices on presentation. For
example, the UA may provide options for readers with visual
impairments or may provide the choice to disable blinking.</P>

<dt><dfn><strong>Error conditions</strong></dfn>
<dd>This specification does not define how conforming user agents
handle general error conditions, including how user agents
behave when they encounter elements, 
attributes, attribute values, or
entities not specified in this document. 

<P>Since user agents may vary in how they handle error conditions,
authors and users must not rely on specific error recovery behavior.
