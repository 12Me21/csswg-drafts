<H2>Conventions</H2>
<H3>CSS property definitions</H3>
<P>Each CSS property definition begins with a summary of key
information that resembles the following:

<P><strong>'Property-name'</strong>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Value:<TD>Possible constant values or value types</TR>
<TR><TH>Initial:<TD>The initial value</TR>
<TR><TH>Applies to:<TD>Elements this property applies to</TR>
<TR><TH>Inherited:<TD>Whether the property is inherited</TR>
<TR><TH>Percentage values:<TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <EM>Value:</EM> N | NW | NE<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [ &lt;length&gt; | thick | thin ]{1,4}<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [&lt;family-name&gt; , ]* &lt;family-name&gt;<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;url&gt;? &lt;color&gt; [ / &lt;color&gt; ]?<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;url&gt; || &lt;color&gt;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P> The words between "&lt;" and "&gt;" give a type of value. The most common
  types are &lt;length&gt;, &lt;percentage&gt;, &lt;url&gt;, &lt;number&gt;
  and &lt;color&gt;; these are described in <A HREF="#units">section 6</A>.
  The more specialized types (e.g. &lt;font-family&gt; and
  &lt;border-style&gt;) are described under the corresponding property.
  <P>
  Other words are keywords that must appear literally, without quotes. The
  slash (/) and the comma (,) must also appear literally.
  <P>
  Several things juxtaposed mean that all of them must occur, in the given
  order. A bar (|) separates alternatives: one of them must occur. A double
  bar (A || B) means that either A or B or both must occur, in any order. Brackets
  ([]) are for grouping. Juxtaposition is stronger than the double bar, and
  the double bar is stronger than the bar. Thus "a b | c || d e" is equivalent
  to "[ a b ] | [ c || [ d e ]]".
  <P>
  Every type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of the following
  modifiers:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      An asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is repeated
      zero or more times.
    <LI>
      A plus (+) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is repeated one
      or more times.
    <LI>
      A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is optional.
    <LI>
      A pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B}) indicates that the preceding type,
      word or group is repeated at least A and at most B times.
  </UL>

<H3>CSS value types</H3>
Value types may be designated in several ways: 
<ol>
<li> constant values (e.g., 'auto', 'disc', etc.)  <li> basic data
types, which appear between "&lt;" and "&gt;" (e.g., <span
class="index-inst" title="&lt;length&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-length">&lt;length&gt;</span></span>, <span
class="index-inst" title="&lt;percentage&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-percentage">&lt;percentage&gt;</span></span>,
etc.). In the electronic version of the document, each instance of a
basic data type links to its definition.

<li> non-terminals that have the same range of values as a property
bearing the same name (e.g., &lt;border-width&gt;
&lt;background-attachment&gt;, etc.).  In this case, the non-terminal
names is the property name (complete with quotes) between "&lt;" and
"&gt;" (e.g., &lt;'border-width'&gt;). In the electronic version of
the document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding property definition.

<P>non-terminals that do not share the same name as a property. In
this case, the non-terminal name appears between "&lt;" and "&gt;"
(e.g., &lt;border-width&gt;) and its definition is located near its
first appearance in the specification. In the electronic version of
the document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding value definition.
</ol>

<H3>HTML information</H3>
<P>HTML elements are in all upper case letters (e.g., HTML, BODY, EM,
P). 

<P>HTML attributes are in all lower case lettesr (e.g., src, class,
id).
