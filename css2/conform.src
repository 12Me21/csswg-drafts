<dd><em> This section only defines <a name="conformance">conformance</a> to CSS2. There will be other
levels of CSS in the future that may require a UA to implement a
different set of features in order to conform.</em>
</dd>

<dd>A User Agent is not required to comply with the entire CSS
specification in order to be considered conformant. However, for
subjects addressed by CSS, if a User Agent elects to implement those
subjects in compliance with CSS, it must observe the conformance
criteria listed below. For example, some User Agents may not be able
to implement all of CSS for a given device (e.g., a user agent cannot
render colors when a monitor is monochrome). Since the User Agent
cannot, in this case, implement part of the specification, it is not
considered to conform to that part of the specification. It may still
comply to other parts of the specification.
</dd>

<dd>A User Agent that uses CSS2 <strong>to display</strong> documents
conforms to the CSS2 specification if it:
  <UL>
    <LI> attempts to fetch all referenced style sheets and parse them
    according to this specification 

    <LI> sorts the declarations according to the <a
	    href="./cascade.html#cascade-order">cascade order</a>.

    <LI> implements the CSS2 functionality within the <a
    href="#presentation-constraints">constraints of the presentation
    medium</a> (see explanation below).

    <LI> implements all of CSS1, not just the core sections.
  </UL>
</dd>
<dd>A User Agent that <strong>outputs</strong> CSS2 style sheets
conforms to the CSS2 specification if it:

  <UL>
    <LI>
      outputs valid CSS2 style sheets
  </UL>

<P> A User Agent that uses CSS2 to display documents <EM>and</EM>
outputs CSS2 style sheets conforms to the CSS2 specification if it
meets both sets of conformance requirements.
</dd>

<dd>This specification also recommends, but doesn't require, that a
UA:

  <UL>
    <LI> allows the reader to specify personal style sheets
    <LI> allows individual style sheets to be turned on and off
    <LI> approximate style sheet values even if it can't implement
		      them exactly according to the specification.
      
  </UL>

<P> The above conformance rules describe only functionality, not user
	interface. 

<P>Different user interface
paradigms may have their own constraints: a VR browser may rescale the
document based on its "distance" from the user.

<P> UAs may offer readers additional choices on presentation. For
example, the UA may provide options for readers with visual
impairments or may provide the choice to disable blinking.

<H2>Conventions</H2>
<H3>CSS property definitions</H3>
<P>Each CSS property definition begins with a summary of key
information that resembles the following:

<P><strong>'Property-name'</strong>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH>Value:<TD>Possible constant values or value types</TR>
<TR><TH>Initial:<TD>The initial value</TR>
<TR><TH>Applies to:<TD>Elements this property applies to</TR>
<TR><TH>Inherited:<TD>Whether the property is inherited</TR>
<TR><TH>Percentage values:<TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <EM>Value:</EM> N | NW | NE<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [ &lt;length&gt; | thick | thin ]{1,4}<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [&lt;family-name&gt; , ]* &lt;family-name&gt;<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;url&gt;? &lt;color&gt; [ / &lt;color&gt; ]?<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;url&gt; || &lt;color&gt;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

  <P> The words between "&lt;" and "&gt;" give a type of value. The most common
  types are &lt;length&gt;, &lt;percentage&gt;, &lt;url&gt;, &lt;number&gt;
  and &lt;color&gt;; these are described in <A HREF="#units">section 6</A>.
  The more specialized types (e.g. &lt;font-family&gt; and
  &lt;border-style&gt;) are described under the corresponding property.
  <P>
  Other words are keywords that must appear literally, without quotes. The
  slash (/) and the comma (,) must also appear literally.
  <P>
  Several things juxtaposed mean that all of them must occur, in the given
  order. A bar (|) separates alternatives: one of them must occur. A double
  bar (A || B) means that either A or B or both must occur, in any order. Brackets
  ([]) are for grouping. Juxtaposition is stronger than the double bar, and
  the double bar is stronger than the bar. Thus "a b | c || d e" is equivalent
  to "[ a b ] | [ c || [ d e ]]".
  <P>
  Every type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of the following
  modifiers:
  <UL>
    <LI>
      An asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is repeated
      zero or more times.
    <LI>
      A plus (+) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is repeated one
      or more times.
    <LI>
      A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is optional.
    <LI>
      A pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B}) indicates that the preceding type,
      word or group is repeated at least A and at most B times.
  </UL>

<H3>CSS value types</H3>
Value types may be designated in several ways: 
<ol>
<li> constant values (e.g., 'auto', 'disc', etc.)  <li> basic data
types, which appear between "&lt;" and "&gt;" (e.g., <span
class="index-inst" title="&lt;length&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-length">&lt;length&gt;</span></span>, <span
class="index-inst" title="&lt;percentage&gt;"><span
class="value-inst-percentage">&lt;percentage&gt;</span></span>,
etc.). In the electronic version of the document, each instance of a
basic data type links to its definition.

<li> non-terminals that have the same range of values as a property
bearing the same name (e.g., &lt;border-width&gt;
&lt;background-attachment&gt;, etc.).  In this case, the non-terminal
names is the property name (complete with quotes) between "&lt;" and
"&gt;" (e.g., &lt;'border-width'&gt;). In the electronic version of
the document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding property definition.

<li> non-terminals that do not share the same name as a property. In
this case, the non-terminal name appears between "&lt;" and "&gt;"
(e.g., &lt;border-width&gt;) and its definition is located near its
first appearance in the specification. In the electronic version of
the document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding value definition.
</ol>

<H3>HTML conventions</H3>
<P>HTML elements are in all upper case letters (e.g., HTML, BODY, EM,
P). 

<P>HTML attributes are in all lower case lettesr (e.g., src, class,
id).
