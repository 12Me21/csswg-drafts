<H1 align="center">Introduction to CSS2</H1> 
<H2>A brief CSS2 tutorial</H2>
<P> In this tutorial, we show how easy it can be to design simple
style sheets. For this tutorial, you will need to know a little 
<a rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a>
and some basic desktop publishing terminology.

<P>We begin with the following (incomplete) HTML body:

<PRE>
   &lt;BODY&gt;
   &lt;H1&gt;Getting started with style sheets&lt;/H1&gt;
   <em>...Some text about style sheets...</em>
   &lt;H1&gt;Style sheet tricks&lt;/H1&gt;
   <em>...Some text about style sheet tricks...</em>
   &lt;/BODY&gt;
</PRE>

<P>To set the text color of the H1 elements to blue, you can write the
following CSS rule:

<PRE>
  H1 { color: blue }
</PRE>

<P>The <a rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a>
specification defines how style sheet rules may be included in or
linked to an HTML document (in the element's start tag, in the head of
the document, or linked externally). Please consult 
the <a rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a>
specification for details and recommended usage.

<P>In our example, we place the rule in the HEAD of the
document in a STYLE element:

<PRE>
   &lt;HEAD&gt;
   &lt;STYLE&gt;
   H1 { color: blue }
   &lt;/STYLE&gt;
   &lt;/HEAD&gt;
   &lt;BODY&gt;
   &lt;H1&gt;Getting started with style sheets&lt;/H1&gt;
   <em>...Some text about style sheets...</em>
   &lt;H1&gt;Style sheet tricks&lt;/H1&gt;
   <em>...Some text about style sheet tricks...</em>
   &lt;/BODY&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Note that what appears within the STYLE element's start and end
tags has CSS syntax, not HTML syntax.

<P>This example illustrates a simple CSS rule. A rule consists of two
main parts: <a href="selector.html">selector</a> ('H1') and
declaration ('color: blue'). The declaration has two parts: property
('color') and value ('blue'). While the example above tries to
influence only one of the properties needed for rendering an HTML
document, it qualifies as a style sheet on its own. Combined with
other style sheets (one fundamental feature of CSS is that style
sheets are combined) it will determine the final presentation of the
document.

<P> The selector is the link between the HTML document and the style
sheet, and all HTML element types are possible selectors. HTML element
types are defined in the <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./refs.html#ref-HTML40">[HTML40]</a> specification.

<P> The <span class="propinst-color">'color'</span> property is one of around
50 properties defined in this specification that determine the
presentation of an HTML document. 

<P>HTML authors only need to write style sheets if they want to
suggest a specific style for their documents. Each user agent (UA)
will have a default style sheet that presents documents in a
reasonable -- but arguably mundane -- manner. This specification
includes a <a href="./sample.html">sample style sheet</a> to
present HTML documents as suggested in the HTML 2.0 specification.

<P>This specification also defines the 
<a href="./grammar.html">formal grammar</a> of the CSS2 language.

<P><em>The tutorial will be expanded, perhaps using examples from
the CSS1 book.</em>
