<H1 align="center">About the CSS2 Specification</H1>

<P>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
CSS authors and CSS implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to
CSS's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build <a href="convent.html#conformance">conforming user
agents</a>.

<P>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation
in mind: electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will
no doubt be similar, readers will find some differences. For example,
links will not work in the printed version (obviously), and page
numbers will not appear in the electronic version. In case of a
discrepancy, the electronic version is considered the authoritative
version of the document.

<h2>How to read the specification</h2>

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:

<ul>

<li><P><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification
begins with a general presentation of CSS and becomes more and more
technical and specific towards the end. This is reflected in the
specification's main table of contents, which presents topical
information, and the indexes, which present lower level information in
alphabetical order.</P>

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get
information about syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the
electronic version of the specification includes the following
features:

<ol>

<li>Every reference to a property or value is linked to
its definition in the specification.

<li>Every page will include links to the table of contents and to the
index, so readers will never be more than two links away from finding
the definition of a property or value.

</ol>
</ul>


<h2>How the specification is organized</h2>

<P>This specification includes the following sections:

<dl>

<dt><Strong>Section 2: An introduction CSS2</strong>

<dd>The introduction includes a brief tutorial in CSS2 and
a discussion of design principles behind CSS2. 

<dt><strong>Sections 3 - 19: CSS2 reference manual.</strong>

<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the CSS language
reference. This reference defines the syntax of CSS style sheets, the
semantics of CSS2 properties, and the procedures user agents must
follow to claim <a href="convent.html#conformance">conformance</a>.

<dt><strong>Appendixes:</strong>

<dd>Five appendixes contain information about <a href="sample.html">a
sample style sheet for HTML 4.0</a>, <a href="changes.html">changes
from CSS1 </a>, <a href="notes.html">implementation and
performance notes</a>, <a href="grammar.html">the grammar of CSS2</a>, and
some helpful notes on implementing <a href="fonts.html">WebFonts</a>.

<dt><strong>References:</strong>

<dd>A list of normative and informative references.

<dt><strong>General index:</strong>

<dd>The <a href="indexlist.html">general index</a> contains links to key
concepts, property and value definitions, and other useful
information.

</dl>

<H2>Conventions</H2>

<H3><a href="convent.html#doclanguage">Document language</a> elements
and attributes</H3>

<ul>
<li>CSS property, descriptor, and pseudo-class names are delimited
by single quotes.
<li>CSS values are delimited by single quotes.
<li>Document language element names are in upper case letters.
<li>Document language attribute names are in lower case letters 
and delimited by double quotes.
</ul>

<H3><a name="property-defs">CSS property definitions</a></H3>
<P>Each CSS property definition begins with a summary of key
information that resembles the following:

<P><strong>'Property-name'</strong>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH align="right">Value:<TD>Possible constant values or value types</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Initial:<TD>The initial value</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Applies to:<TD>Elements this property applies to</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Inherited:<TD>Whether the property is inherited</TR>
<TR><TH align="right">Percentage values:<TD>How percentage values should be interpreted</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The five categories have the following meanings:

<dl>
<dt><strong>Value</strong>
<dd>This part of the property definition specifies the set of valid
values for the property. Value types may be designated in several ways:

<ol>
<li> constant values (e.g., 'auto', 'disc', etc.)  

<li> basic data types, which appear between "&lt;" and "&gt;" (e.g.,
&lt;length&gt;, &lt;percentage&gt;, etc.). In the electronic version
of the document, each instance of a basic data type links to its
definition.

<li> non-terminals that have the same range of values as a property
bearing the same name (e.g., &lt;border-width&gt;
&lt;background-attachment&gt;, etc.).  In this case, the non-terminal
name is the property name (complete with quotes) between "&lt;" and
"&gt;" (e.g., &lt;'border-width'&gt;). In the electronic version of
the document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding property definition.

<li> non-terminals that do not share the same name as a property. In
this case, the non-terminal name appears between "&lt;" and "&gt;"
(e.g., &lt;border-width&gt;) and its definition is located near its
first appearance in the specification. In the electronic version of
the document, each instance of this type of non-terminal links to the
corresponding value definition.
</ol>

Other words are keywords that must appear literally, without
quotes. The slash (/) and the comma (,) must also appear literally.


<P> Several things juxtaposed mean that all of them must occur, in the
given order. A bar (|) separates alternatives: one of them must
occur. A double bar (A || B) means that either A or B or both must
occur, in any order. Brackets ([]) are for grouping. Juxtaposition is
stronger than the double bar, and the double bar is stronger than the
bar. Thus "a b | c || d e" is equivalent to "[ a b ] | [ c || [ d e
]]".


<P> Every type, keyword, or bracketed group may be followed by one of
the following modifiers:

  <UL>
    <LI>
      An asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is repeated
      zero or more times.
    <LI>
      A plus (+) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is repeated one
      or more times.
    <LI>
      A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type, word or group is optional.
    <LI>
      A pair of numbers in curly braces ({A,B}) indicates that the preceding type,
      word or group is repeated at least A and at most B times.
  </UL>


<div class="example"><P>
The following examples illustrate different value types:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <EM>Value:</EM> N | NW | NE<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [ &lt;length&gt; | thick | thin ]{1,4}<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> [&lt;family-name&gt; , ]* &lt;family-name&gt;<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;url&gt;? &lt;color&gt; [ / &lt;color&gt; ]?<BR>
    <EM>Value:</EM> &lt;url&gt; || &lt;color&gt;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</div>

<dt><strong>Initial</strong>
<dd>The property's default value. If the property is inherited, this
is the value that is given to the root element of the
document. Otherwise it is the value that the property will have if
there are no style rules for it in either the user's or the designer's
style sheet.</dd>

<dt><strong>Applies to</strong>

<dd>Lists the elements to which the property applies. All elements are
considered to have all properties, but some properties have no
rendering effect on some types of elements. For example, <span
class="propinst-font-style">'font-style'</span> has no effect if the
element is an image.
</dd>

<dt><strong>Inherited</strong>
<dd>Indicates whether the value of the property is inherited from a
parent element.</dd>

<dt><strong>Percentage values</strong>
<dd>Indicates how percentages should be interpreted, if they occur in
the value of the property. If "N/A" appears here, it means that the
property does not accept percentages as values.</dd>

<dt><strong>Applies to media</strong>
<dd>Indicates the <a href="media.html">media</a> 
for which the property applies.
</dd>
</dl>

<H3>HTML conventions</H3> 
<P>In this specification, most of the examples refer to HTML. For
clarity, HTML elements are written with upper case letters (e.g.,
HTML, BODY, EM, P) and HTML attributes are written with lower case
letters (e.g., src, class, id).
