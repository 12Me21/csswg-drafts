<H1 align="center">About the CSS2 Specification</H1>

<P>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
CSS authors and CSS implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to
CSS's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build user agents that interpret CSS correctly.

<P>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation
in mind: electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will
no doubt be similar, readers will find some differences. For example,
links will not work in the printed version (obviously), and page
numbers will not appear in the electronic version. In case of a
discrepancy, the electronic version is considered the authoritative
version of the document.

<h2>How to read the specification</h2>

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:

<ul>

<li><P><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification
begins with a general presentation of CSS and becomes more and more
technical and specific towards the end. This is reflected in the
specification's main table of contents, which presents topical
information, and the indexes, which present lower level information in
alphabetical order.</P>

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get
information about syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the
electronic version of the specification includes the following
features:

<ol>

<li>Every reference to an property or value is linked to
its definition in the specification.

<li>Every page will include links to the table of contents and to the
index, so readers of the electronic version will never be more than
two links away from finding the definition of a property or value.

</ol>
</ul>


<h2>How the specification is organized</h2>

<P>This specification includes the following sections:

<dl>

<dt><Strong>Section 3: An introduction CSS2</strong>

<dd>The introduction begins with a brief tutorial in CSS2. The
following section discusses design principles behind CSS2. Finally, we
provide a list of suggested practice for style sheet authors.

<dt><strong>Sections 4 - 17: CSS2 reference manual.</strong>

<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the CSS language
reference, which describes and defines all CSS properties.

<dt><strong>Section 18 - 22: Appendixes.</strong>

<dd>The appendix contains information about <a href="sample.html">a
sample style sheet for HTML 2.0</a>, <a href="changes.html">changes
from CSS1 </a>, <a href="appendix/notes.html">implementation and
performance </a>, <a href="grammar.html">the grammar of CSS2</a>, and
a list of normative and informative references.

<dt><strong>Section 23: General index.</strong>

<dd>The <a href="index.html">general index</a> contains links to key
concepts, property and value definitions, and other useful
information.

<P>Robert Stevahn (HP), along with Scott Furman (Netscape) and Scott
Isaacs (Microsoft) were key contributors to CSS positioning.

<P>Mike Wexler (Adobe) was the editor of the interim Working Draft
which described much of the new features of CSS2.

<P>Todd Fahrner (Verso) researched contemporary and historical
browsers to develop the sample style sheet in the appendix.

<P>Through electronic and physical encounters, the following people
have contributed to the development of CSS2: James Clark, Daniel
Connolly, Donna Converse, Scott Isaacs, Lou Montulli, Henrik Frystyk
Nielsen, Jacob Nielsen, William Perry, David Siegel and Stephen Zilles.

<P>The discussions on www-style@w3.org have been influential in many
key issues for CSS. Especially, we would like to thank Bjorn Backlund,
Todd Fahrner, MegaZone, Eric Meyer, David Perrell, Liam Quinn and
Chris Wilson for their participation.

<P>Special thanks to Arnaud Le Hors, whose engineering contributions
made this document work.

<P>Lastly, thanks to Tim Berners-Lee without whom none of this would
have been possible.
