<H1 align="center">About the CSS2 Specification</H1>

<P>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
CSS authors and CSS implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to
CSS's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build user agents that interpret CSS correctly.

<P>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation
in mind: electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will
no doubt be similar, readers will find some differences. For example,
links will not work in the printed version (obviously), and page
numbers will not appear in the electronic version. In case of a
discrepancy, the electronic version is considered the authoritative
version of the document.

<h2>How to read the specification</h2>

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:

<ul>
<li><P><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification
begins with a general presentation of CSS and becomes more and more
technical and specific towards the end. This is reflected in the
specification's main table of contents, which presents topical
information, and the indexes, which present lower level information in
alphabetical order.</P>

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get
information about syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the
electronic version of the specification includes the following
features:

<ol>
<li>Every reference to an property or value is linked to
its definition in the specification.

<li>Every page will include links to the index, so you will never be
more than two links away from finding the definition of
a property or value.

</ol>
</ul>


<h2>How the specification is organized</h2>
This specification includes the following sections:

<dl>
<dt><Strong>Section 2: A brief CSS2 tutorial</strong>
<dd>The introduction gives an overview of what can be done with CSS
	  level 2. It also provides some design tips for developing
	  good CSS habits.
</dd>

<dt><Strong>Section 3: A brief CSS2 tutorial</strong>
<dd>This section explains some of the design rationale behind
	  CSS2. These are good ideas to keep in mind as you read the
	  rest of the specification.
</dd>

<dt><strong>Sections 4 - 19: CSS2 reference manual.</strong>
<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the CSS language
reference, which describes and defines all CSS properties.

<dt><strong>Section 20 - 23: Appendixes.</strong>

<dd>The appendix contains
information about <a href="sample.html">a sample style sheet for HTML
	    2.0</a>, <a href="changes.html">changes from CSS1
</a>, <a href="appendix/notes.html">implementation and performance 
</a>, and <a href="grammar.html">the grammar of CSS2</a>.
</dd>

<dt><strong>Section 24: General index.</strong>

<dd>The <a href="index.html">general index</a> contains links to key
	  concepts, property and value definitions, and other useful
	  information. 
</dd>

<H2>Acknowledgments</H2> 

<P>During the short life of HTML, there have been several style sheet
proposals (available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C Web site)
to which this proposal is indebted. Especially the proposals from
Robert Raisch, Joe English and Pei Wei were influential.

<P> A number of people have contributed to the development of CSS1. We
would especially like to thank: Terry Allen, Murray Altheim, Glenn
Adams, Walter Bender, Tim Berners-Lee, Yves Bertot, Scott Bigham,
