<H1 align="center">About the CSS2 Specification</H1>

<P>This document has been written with two types of readers in mind:
CSS authors and CSS implementors. We hope the specification will
provide authors with the tools they need to write efficient,
attractive, and accessible documents, without overexposing them to
CSS's implementation details. Implementors, however, should find all
they need to build <a href="convent.html#conformance">conforming user
agents</a>.

<P>The specification has been written with two modes of presentation
in mind: electronic and printed. Although the two presentations will
no doubt be similar, readers will find some differences. For example,
links will not work in the printed version (obviously), and page
numbers will not appear in the electronic version. In case of a
discrepancy, the electronic version is considered the authoritative
version of the document.

<h2>How to read the specification</h2>

<p>The specification may be approached in several ways:

<ul>

<li><P><strong>Read from beginning to end.</strong> The specification
begins with a general presentation of CSS and becomes more and more
technical and specific towards the end. This is reflected in the
specification's main table of contents, which presents topical
information, and the indexes, which present lower level information in
alphabetical order.</P>

<li><strong>Quick access to information.</strong> In order to get
information about syntax and semantics as quickly as possible, the
electronic version of the specification includes the following
features:

<ol>

<li>Every reference to a property or value is linked to
its definition in the specification.

<li>Every page will include links to the table of contents and to the
index, so readers will never be more than two links away from finding
the definition of a property or value.

</ol>
</ul>


<h2>How the specification is organized</h2>

<P>This specification includes the following sections:

<dl>

<dt><Strong>Section 2: An introduction CSS2</strong>

<dd>The introduction includes a brief tutorial in CSS2 and
a discussion of design principles behind CSS2. 

<dt><strong>Sections 3 - 19: CSS2 reference manual.</strong>

<dd>The bulk of the reference manual consists of the CSS language
reference. This reference defines the syntax of CSS style sheets, the
semantics of CSS2 properties, and the procedures user agents must
follow to claim <a href="convent.html#conformance">conformance</a>.

<dt><strong>Appendixes:</strong>

<dd>Five appendixes contain information about <a href="sample.html">a
sample style sheet for HTML 4.0</a>, <a href="changes.html">changes
from CSS1 </a>, <a href="notes.html">implementation and
performance notes</a>, <a href="grammar.html">the grammar of CSS2</a>, and
some helpful notes on implementing <a href="fonts.html">WebFonts</a>.

<dt><strong>References:</strong>

<dd>A list of normative and informative references.

<dt><strong>General index:</strong>

<dd>The <a href="indexlist.html">general index</a> contains links to key
concepts, property and value definitions, and other useful
information.
