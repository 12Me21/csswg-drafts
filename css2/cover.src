<h2 id=abstract>Abstract</h2> 

<p>This specification defines Cascading Style Sheets, level&nbsp;2
revision&nbsp;1 (CSS&nbsp;2.1). CSS&nbsp;2.1 is a style sheet language
that allows
authors and users to attach style (e.g., fonts and spacing) to
structured documents (e.g., HTML documents and XML
applications). By separating the presentation style of documents from
the content of documents, CSS&nbsp;2.1 simplifies Web authoring and
site maintenance.

<P>CSS&nbsp;2.1 builds on CSS2 [[CSS2]] which builds on CSS1 [[CSS1]].
It supports media-specific style sheets so that authors may tailor the
presentation of their documents to visual browsers, aural devices,
printers, braille devices, handheld devices, etc. It also supports
content positioning, table layout, features for internationalization
and some properties related to user interface.

<p>CSS&nbsp;2.1 corrects a few errors in CSS2 (the most important
being a new definition of the height/width of absolutely positioned
elements, more influence for HTML's "style" attribute and a new
calculation of the 'clip' property), and adds a few highly requested
features which have already been widely implemented.
But most of all CSS&nbsp;2.1
represents a "snapshot" of CSS usage: it consists of all CSS features
that are implemented interoperably at the date of publication of the Recommendation.

<h2 id=status>Status of this document</h2>

<p>This is a W3C <a

believes that this specification is ready and therefore wishes this to
be the last call for comments. If the feedback is positive, the
working group plans to submit it for consideration as a <a

<h3 class="no-num" id="crec">Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria</h3>

<p>For this specification to exit the CR stage, the following
conditions must be met:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
   <p>There must be at least two interoperable implementations
   for every feature. For the purposes of this criterion,
   we define the following terms:</p>
   <dl>
    <dt>feature</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      A section or subsection of the specification.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>interoperable</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>passing the respective test cases in the test suite, or,
     if the implementation is not a web browser, equivalent tests.
     Every relevant test in the test suite should have an equivalent
     test created if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability.
     In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
     then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass
     those equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
     interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
     available for the purposes of peer review.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>a user agent which:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>implements the feature.</li>
      <li>is available (i.e. publicly downloadable or available
      through some other public point of sale mechanism). This is the
      "show me" requirement.</li>
      <li>is shipping (i.e. development, private or unofficial
      versions are insufficient).</li>
      <li>is not experimental (i.e. is intended for a wide audience
      and could be used on a daily basis).</li>
     </ol>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </li>
  <li><p>A minimum of six months of the CR period must have elapsed.
  This is to ensure that enough time is given for any remaining major
  errors to be caught.</p></li>
  <li><p>The CR period will be extended if implementations are slow to
  appear.</p></li>
  <li><p>Features will be dropped (thus reducing the list of "all"
  features mentioned above) if two or more interoperable
  implementations of those features are not found by the end of the CR
  period.</p></li>
  <li><p>Features will also be dropped if sufficient and adequate
  tests (by judgment of the working group) have not been produced for
  those features by the end of the CR period.</p></li>
 </ol>
</ins>

title="issue 15">
<p>For this specification to exit the CR stage, the following
conditions shall be met:
<ol>
  <li><p>There must be at least two interoperable implementations
  implementing 'all' the features. An implementation can implement a
  superset of the features and claim conformance to the profile. For
  the purposes of this criterion, we define the following terms:

  <dl>
    <dt>feature
    <dd>
    <p>An individual test case in the test suite.

    <dt>interoperable
    <dd>
    <p>passing the respective test case(s) in the CSS test suite, or,
    if the implementation is not a web browser, an equivalent test.
    Every relevant test in the test suite should have an equivalent
    test created if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability.
    In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
    then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass
    those equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly

  implementations are not found by the end of the CR period.

  <li><p>Features may/will also be dropped if adequate/sufficient (by
  judgment of CSS WG) tests have not been produced for those
  feature(s) by the end of the CR period.
