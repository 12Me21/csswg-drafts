<H1 align="center">Text</H1>
<H2><a name="line-height">The height of lines</a></H2>

<P> All elements have a <span class="propinst">'line-height'</span>
property that, in principle, gives the total height of a line of
text. Space is added above and below the text of the line to arrive at
that line height. For example, if the text is 12pt high and <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> is set to '14pt', an extra space
of 2pt is added, namely 1pt above and 1pt below the line. Empty
elements influence these calculations just like elements with content.

<P> The difference between the font size and the <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> is called the <span
class="index-def" title="leading"><EM>leading</EM></span>. Half the
leading is called the <span class="index-def"
title="half-leading"><EM>half-leading</EM></span>. After formatting,
each line will form a rectangular <span class="index-def"
title="line-box"><EM>line-box</EM></span>.

<P> If a line of text contains sections with different <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> values (because there are inline
elements on the line), then each of those sections has its own
half-leading above and below. The height of the line-box is from the
top of the highest section to the bottom of the lowest one. Note that
the top and bottom do not necessarily correspond to the tallest
element, since elements can be positioned vertically with the 
<span class="propinst">'vertical-align'</span> property. To form a
paragraph, each line-box is stacked immediately below the previous
line.

<P> Note that any padding, border or margin above and below
non-replaced inline elements does not influence the height of the
line. In other words: if the <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> is too small for the chosen
padding or border, it will overlap with text on other lines.

<P> Replaced elements (e.g., images) on the line can make the line-box
bigger, if the top of the replaced element (i.e., including all of its
padding, border and margin) is above the tallest text section, or if
the bottom is below the lowest.

<P> In the normal case, when there is only one value of <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> throughout a paragraph, and no
tall images, the definition above will ensure that baselines of
successive lines are exactly <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> apart. This is important when
columns of text in different fonts have to be aligned, for example in
a table.

<P> Note that this doesn't preclude the text on two adjacent lines
from overlapping each other. The <span
class="propinst">'line-height'</span> may be smaller than the height
of the text, in which case the leading will be negative. This is
useful if you know that the text will contain no descenders (e.g.,
because it only contains uppercase), so the lines can be put closer
together.
<H2>Text in HTML</H2>
<H3>BR elements</H3>

<P> The current CSS2 properties and values cannot describe the
behavior of the BR element. In HTML, the BR element specifies a
line break between words.  In effect, the element is replaced by a
line break. Future versions of CSS may handle added and replaced
content, but CSS2-based formatters must treat BR specially.
