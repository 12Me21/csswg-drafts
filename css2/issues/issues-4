  What to do with Unicode escapes above U+10FFFF

Resolution:

  A UA should display something, such as a replacement character or a
  missing glyph character. Bert to add something to either chapter 4
  or chapter 15.

  Actual text added to 4.1.3:

    If the number is outside the range allowed by Unicode (e.g.,
    "\110000" is above the maximum 10FFFF allowed in current Unicode),
    the UA may replace the escape with the "replacement character"
    (U+FFFD). If the character is to be displayed, the UA should show a
    visible symbol, such as a "missing character" glyph (cf. 15.2, point
    5).
