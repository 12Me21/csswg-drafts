  New proposal:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2007AprJun/0250.html

  Add explicitly undefined cases to bullet 5 in 17.5

Resolution:

  (After discussing with the Director:) the layout of illegal XHTML
  tables (and all similar combinations of rowspan/colspan in other
  formats) when rendered with CSS's table properties is explicitly
  undefined, as follows:

  Change this text in bullet 5 of 17.5

      The rectangle must be as far to the left as possible, but it
      may not overlap with any other cell box, and must be to the
      right of all cells in the same row that are earlier in the
      source document. (This constraint holds if the 'direction'
      property of the table is 'ltr'; if the 'direction' is 'rtl',
      interchange "left" and "right" in the previous sentence.)

  to

      The rectangle must be as far to the left as possible, but the
      part of the cell in the first column it occupies must not
      overlap with any other cell box (i.e., a row-spanning cell
      starting in a prior row), and the cell must be to the right of
      all cells in the same row that are earlier in the source
      document. If this position would cause a column-spanning cell
      to overlap a row-spanning cell from a prior row, CSS does not
      define the results: implementations may either overlap the
      cells (as is done in many HTML implementations) or may shift
      the later cell to the right to avoid such overlap. (This
      constraint holds if the 'direction' property of the table is
      'ltr'; if the 'direction' is 'rtl', interchange "left" and
      "right" in the previous two sentences.)

  Also change the following example and its image caption
  correspondingly.

  The Min-Max Issue

Proposal:

  Leave spec as-is and continue with image-scaling in CSS3. Add note:

  Note: In cases where an explicit width or height is set and the other
  dimension is auto, applying a minimum or maximum constraint on the
  auto side can cause an over-constrained situation. The spec is clear
  in the behavior but it might not be what the author expects. The CSS3
  image-fit property can be used to obtain different results in this
  situation.

URI: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2006Dec/0057.html
Description:

  Empty inline elements should act like display: none; (?)

  [Needs testcase]

Proposal 1:

  Line boxes that contain no text, no spaces, and no in-flow content
  (such as images, inline blocks or inline tables), and don't end with
  a line feed must be taken out of flow and not rendered. Inline
  elements on such line boxes must not be rendered. For the purposes
  of finding the static position for positioning or position for
  floats, an anonymous block that acts as a parent of these elements
  must be assumed to replace the line box.

Proposal 2:

  Line boxes that contain no text, no preserved white space, and no
  in-flow content (such as images, inline blocks or inline tables),
  and don't end with a line feed must be taken out of flow and not
  rendered. Inline elements on such line boxes must not be rendered.
  The static position and the position for floats is calculated as
  if such inline elements were anonymous blocks.

Proposal 3:

  Line boxes that contain no text, no preserved white space, no inline
  elements with non-zero margins, padding, or borders, and no other
  in-flow content (such as images, inline blocks or inline tables),
  and don't end with a line feed must be taken out of flow and not
  rendered. Inline elements on such line boxes must not be rendered.
  The static position of such inline elements is calculated with
  respect to an anonymous block that replaces the line box. This
  anonymous block is the containing block for any descendant floats.

Proposal 4:

  Line boxes that contain no text, no preserved white space, no inline
  elements with non-zero margins, padding, or borders, and no other
  in-flow content (such as images, inline blocks or inline tables),
  and don't end with a line feed must be taken out of flow and not
  rendered. Inline elements on such line boxes must not be rendered.
  The static and relatively-positioned position of such inline elements
  is the static position of an anonymous block that replaces the
  line box. This anonymous block is the containing block for any
  descendant floats.

Proposal 5:

  Empty inline elements without padding, margins or borders (and ignored
  height) on an otherwise empty line box do not participate in rendering.
  For positioning purposes treat the empty inline as an empty block box.

Proposal 6:

  Line boxes that contain no text, no preserved white space, no inline
  elements with non-zero margins, padding, or borders, and no other
  in-flow content (such as images, inline blocks or inline tables),
  and don't end with a line feed must be treated as zero-height line
  boxes. For the purposes of margin collapsing, this line box must be
  ignored.

  Proposal 6 accepted for 9.4.2.

URI: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2007JanMar/att-0376/MarginCollapsingSamples070302.htm
Description:

  9.5.2 defines behavior of 'clear' as follows:

    Computing the clearance of an element on which 'clear' is set is done
    by first determining the hypothetical position of the element's top
    border edge within its parent block. This position is determined after
    the top margin of the element has been *collapsed* with previous
    adjacent margins (including the top margin of the parent block).

    If the element's top border edge has not passed the relevant floats,
    then its clearance is set to the amount necessary to place the border
    edge of the block even with the bottom outer edge of the lowest float
    that must be cleared.

  However 8.3.1 describes collapsing margins as

    In this specification, the expression collapsing margins means that
    adjoining margins (no non-empty content, padding or border areas or
    *clearance* separate them) of two or more boxes (which may be next to
    one another or nested) combine to form a single margin.

  This creates a circular reference which makes the two rules contradictory.

Original proposal from MS:

  In 8.3.1, remove all 5 instances of the word 'clearance' (and whole sentences
  that are not needed without 'clearance')

  Note:
    Clearance was added as a concept at Oslo f2f in 2003. It was added both
    to 9.5.2 and 8.3.1. However since margin collapsing happens before
    clearance, it doesn't need to have clearance-related rules.

Description:

  Make XHTML <body> magic like HTML <body>.

Proposal:

   6.4.4 paragraph 2: change "For HTML" to "For HTML and XHTML".

   11.1.1: Change the sentence "HTML UAs must instead apply the 'overflow' 
   property from the BODY element to the viewport, if the value on the 
   HTML element is 'visible'." to:

      When the root element is an HTML "HTML" element or an XHTML "html" 
      element, and that element has an HTML "BODY" element or an XHTML 
      "body" element as a child, user agents must instead apply the 
      'overflow' property from the first such child element to the 
      viewport, if the value on the root element is 'visible'.

   14.2 paragraph 4: change to:

      For HTML documents, however, we recommend that authors specify the
      background for the BODY element rather than the HTML element. For 
      documents whose root element is an HTML "HTML" element or an XHTML 
      "html" element that has computed values of 'transparent'
      for 'background-color' and 'none' for 'background-image', user 
      agents must instead use the computed value of those properties from 
      that element's first HTML "BODY" element or XHTML "body" element 
      child when painting backgrounds for the canvas, and must not paint a 
      background for that child element. Such backgrounds must also be 
      anchored at the same point as they would be if they were painted 
      only for the root element.

   17.5 paragraph 2: change the last sentence to: "These rules do not 
   apply to HTML or XHTML; HTML imposes its own limitations on row and 
   column spans."

   17.5 final example: This would need various editorial changes to 
   indicate that the second example is not XHTML but some non-HTML XML 
   vocabulary.

Description: 

  Confusion over newlines and line feed

Proposal:

  Add after the value definitions in 16.6:
    "Newlines in the source can be represented by a carriage return
    (U+000D), a linefeed (U+000A) or both (U+000D U+000A) or by some
    other mechanism that identifies the beginning and end of document
    segments, such as the SGML RECORD-START and RECORD-END tokens.
    The CSS 'white-space' processing model assumes all newlines have
    been normalized to line feeds."

    [...] the third paragraph of 10.6.2 states the
    same thing, essentially, three times:

    I think we can replace all that with

       | Otherwise if 'height' has a computed value of 'auto' and the
       | element does have an intrinsic ratio then the used value of
       | 'height' is:

    since that second case covers the other two.

  Bert agrees and thinks this is editorial.
