CSS2.1 Second Last Call Issues List
===================================

OPEN ISSUES have the marker =WG= in them.

TO RESOLVE AN ISSUE add the line "Resolution:" followed by the
description of the resolution, and then a line on its own with either
one of "=Bert= Edit.", "=howcome= Edit.", and "=Tantek= Edit.", if an
edit is to be made, or just the line "Issue closed." if the issue is
closed. See other issues for examples.

Issue 1.

URI: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2004JulSep/0062
Description:
img:before not defined
Resolution:
img:before explicitly not defined in CSS2.1 because we are looking for
implementation and author feedback and will define this in more detail
in CSS3.
We never actually put our resolution in the spec, though.

Add the following sentence to the end of section 12.1 "The :before and
:after pseudo-elements":

   This specification does not fully define the interaction of :before
   and :after with replaced elements (such as IMG in HTML). This will
   be defined in more detail in CSS3.

Description:
Unclear that word-spacing applies to NBSP characters.
Proposed changes (text.html, section "Letter and word spacing"):
  change
   "When white space is preserved, e.g. with 'white-space:pre', all
    space characters are affected by word-spacing."
  to
   "Word spacing affects each space (U+0020), non-breaking space
    (U+00A0), and ideographic space (U+3000) left in the text after
    the white space processing rules have been applied."
Resolution:
Apply change described above.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 4.
URI: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2005AprJun/0175.html
Description:
I was just looking at the HTML diffs, and noticed that the computed
value for 'content' probably needs to reflect what is stated in the
definition of the 'normal' value:  that a specified value of 'normal'
computes to 'none' for pseudo-elements:

  http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-CSS21-20050613/generate.html#content

(Should it also say that the computed value for elements is always
normal?  Are we consistent about how we describe computed values in
cases where a property doesn't apply?)

Proposal: Change the 'computed value' line to:

  On elements, always computes to 'normal'. On :before and :after, if
  'normal' is specified, computes to 'none'. Otherwise, for URI
  values, the absolute URI; for attr() values, the resulting string;
  for other keywords, as specified.

Resolution:
Apply change described above.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 5.
URI: http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2005/06/displayinline_a.html
Description:
Authors use 'display:inline' on <table> elements to make inline
tables, which works in IE but breaks in compliant UAs.

Proposal: Add the following statement in 17.2.1 in points 2, 3, and 4
after the sentences ending in "P and T":

   If P is an 'inline' box, then the generated box must be an
   'inline-table' box instead of a 'table' box.

Resolution:
Accept proposal.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 6.
Description:
(o173071)
The grammar definition of an identifier differs from the prose
definition. The prose, in fact, has two separate definitions for
different things.

Issue 7.
Description:
The following note is repeated twice in the current draft. (Section 5.8.3)
# Note: If an element has multiple class attributes, their values must
# be concatenated with spaces between the values before searching for
# the class. As of this time the working group is not aware of any
# manner in which this situation can be reached, however, so this

Description:
Discussion about the replaced element intrinsic sizing rules,
concluding with the following question: "does the table under
'max-width' still work when the replaced elements use the intrinsic
ratio?"

Resolution:

  Replace "In this table, w and h stand for the intrinsic width and
  height, respectively." with:

  "In this table <var>w</var> and <var>h</var> stand for the results
  of the width and height computations ignoring the 'min-width',
  'min-height', 'max-width' and 'max-height' properties. Normally
  these are the intrinsic width and height, but they may not be in the
  case of replaced elements with intrinsic ratios."

Issue 11.
Description:

It was pointed out in [1] that there is an error in the first example
in section 12.4 [2]. The simplest fix is to add a style rule to the
example:

  body { counter-reset: chapter; }   /* create a chapter counter scope */

so that the implicit counter creation rules don't create a separate
counter for each header.

Issue 16.
URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/42C69AC2.4050504@lachy.id.au
Description:
While attempting to greatly improve upon some CSS tests I had
written previously for the border collapse conflict resolution
algorithm, I've come across an issue in the spec. Step 4 of the
conflict resolution algorithm states [1]:

4. If border styles differ only in color, then a style set on a cell
   wins over one on a row, which wins over a row group, column, column
   group and, lastly, table. It is undefined which color is used when
   two elements of the same type disagree.

It needs to be defined which border of two elements of the same type
takes precedence when they only differ by colour. Both Firefox and
Opera take a completely different approach, yet because the behaviour
is undefined, both are correct. See the test case [2].

Firefox seems to apply the border colour from the cell above or the
left, while Opera seems to apply the border colour from the cell below
or to the right. I think it makes more sense the way Firefox
implements it, but either way, I think it should be defined.

9.4.2, para 4:

> "If that property has the value 'justify', the user agent may stretch

>
> Does UA allowed to stretch *all* inline boxes (including inline blocks) ?

Resolution:

inline-blocks and inline-tables and their contents shouldn't be
affected here, only actual display:inlines.

In 9.4.2, change "the user agent may stretch the inline boxes as
well." to "the user agent may stretch spaces and words in
display:inline boxes as well." In 16.2, change "the UA may stretch the
inline boxes in addition to adjusting their positions" to "this
property specifies that the text is to be made flush with both sides
of the block".

Description:

I just noticed one more change that I think we need to make in section
10.4.  We should change the sentence:

  However, for replaced elements with both 'width' and 'height'
  specified as 'auto', the algorithm is as follows:

to be:

  However, for replaced elements with an intrinsic ratio and both
  'width' and 'height' specified as 'auto', the algorithm is as follows:

because I don't think these rules are intended to apply to IFRAMEs or
OBJECTs that embed HTML documents.  (It was clearer that they didn't
make sense before the change we agreed to this morning that made them
work for the intrinsic-ratio-but-no-intrinsic-size case.)

Resolution:

You have to derive it. In practice you don't need it; as an
implementor you just implement the grammar and make "\" skip past the

just stick a "\" in when things don't work.

We will consider this for CSS3, but it doesn't seem appropriate for
CSS2.1 right now (not a change of functionality, so too late at this

Description:

The description of the empty-cells property begins like this:

    In the separated borders model, this property controls the rendering
    of borders and backgrounds around cells that have no visible content.

Why does it say "in the separated borders model"? There is nothing in the
description of the property that implies that it cannot also apply to the
collapsing border model, and in fact it is used in an example with the
collapsing border model earlier in the spec (17.5.1).

Keep definiton of 'empty-cells' as is (i.e., doesn't apply to
collapsed borders).

Another empty-cells related question: the spec has the following
statement:

    if all the cells in a row have a value of 'hide' and have no visible
    content, the entire row behaves as if it had 'display: none'.

Is this a strict statement, in that a row in this situation will not
increment any counters, nor will the table cells within it?

Or is it a loose statement, in that a row in this situation just won't be
drawn, similar to the effect produced with display: none?

-Michael

Resolution:
Change quotes sentence to:
"If all the cells in a row have a value of 'hide' and have no visible
content, then the row has zero height and there is vertical
border-spacing on only one side of the row."

Description:

The spec states:

| If a subsequent row has more columns than the first, then additional
| columns must not be rendered. When using 'table-layout: fixed',
| authors should not omit columns from the first row.

That indicates that the total number of columns in the table is
determined from the number of columns spanned by the cells in the
first row. However, what if there are more 'table-column' elements
than the first row? Should a UA still determine the number of columns
from the first row or can that be determined from the number of
table-columns?

For example:
<table>
  <col>
  <col>
  <col>
  <col> <!-- 4 columns -->
  <tr>
    <td>test</td>
    <td>test</td>
    <td>test</td> <!-- 3 cells -->
  </tr>
</table>

with this style:
table { table-layout: fixed; width: 100%; }

I tested Firefox 1.0.4, IE6 and Opera 8 and each of them leave space for the 4th cell.

Can the spec be clarified to either explicity allow or disallow this behaviour?

Resolution:
s/If a subsequent row has more columns than the first,/If a subsequent
row has more columns than the greater of the number determined by the
table-column elements and the number determined by the first row,"

Clarification: Section 9.4.3 states that if a relative positioned
element causes an overflow:auto box to overflow, the UA must allow the
user access to the content, with the effect of adding scrollbars (and
possibly forcing re-layout).  Does this also apply to overflow:scroll?

Recommended change:

Section 9.4.3; replace: "However, if relative positioning causes an
'overflow:auto' box to have overflow, ..." with "However, if relative
positioning causes an 'overflow:auto' or 'overflow:scroll' box to have
overflow, ..."

Description:

Clarification: In Section 9.4.3, should the scrolling mechanism that is
used allow the user to scroll to the UNOFFSET position of the relative
element, or the final, offset position?  As written, the text implies
that it is the final, offset position that must be accessible.

Recommended change:

Section 9.4.3; at end of first paragraph add: "The UA must provide
access to the content as if the value of the 'left', 'right', 'top'
and 'bottom' properties of relatively positioned elements were all
zero."

-Markus

I disagree. I think you should be able to move to the final position
to see the actual content. -Ian

Description:

Clarification: The CSS 2.1 spec makes no statement regarding special
treatment for the size of the HTML element.  Should it be:

1. sized as if it were a normal block box (which means it might be
smaller than the available viewport? Opera appears to follow this
approach.

2. increased in size (if smaller than the viewport) to fill the
viewport?

3. increased in size to enclose all absolutely positioned content
whose containing block is the initial containing block? Firefox and
IE6 appear to follow this approach, but there is nothing in the speec
to support this behavior.

Recommended change:

No change required. Just a clarification. The spec is very explicit
that a border of a block box does not extend around an absolute
positioned. Therefore IE and Firefox are misbehaving. Am I right?

-Markus

Yes. For Firefox this is fixed in the latest builds. -Ian

The latter is correct.  When proposing edits for some decisions we made
regarding counters, I didn't even realize that the former section
existed.  Probably the sentence should just be removed (and perhaps much
of the section).

-David

Resolution:

 1. Remove the paragraph:

    # Counters that are not in the scope of any 'counter-reset', are
    # assumed to have been reset to 0 by a 'counter-reset' on the root
    # element. 

 2. Take the sentence at the end of the second paragraph:

    # See "Nested counters and scope" in the chapter on generated
    # content.

    and make it its own paragraph (i.e., the third), and add to the end
    so that it reads:

    # See "Nested counters and scope" in the chapter on generated
    # content for how user agents must determine the value or values of
    # the counter. See the definition of counter values of the
    # <a>'content' property</a> for how it must convert these values to

p { counter-reset: mycounter 1 mycounter 2 mycounter; }

That has three counter-resets on the same element for the same
counter; the scope of the reset to 1 does not include nodes that are
in the scope of the reset to 2; the scope of the reset to 2 does not
include nodes that are in the scope of the reset to 0.

That said, I think the wording of this section should be changed to:

  However, it does not include any elements in the scope of a counter
  _with_the_same_name_ created by a 'counter-reset' on a later sibling
  of the element or by a later 'counter-reset' on the same element.

i18n review comment 5: Phrasing of bidi algorithm requirement.
See also http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-i18n-ig/2003Oct/0227

Elika proposes:

http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#direction

   # Conforming user agents that do not support bidirectional text may
   # ignore the 'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties described in
   # this section.

Append to this paragraph:
   | This exception includes UAs that render right-to-left characters
   | simply because a font on the system contains them but do not
   | support the concept of right-to-left text direction.
which is lifted from the end of the fourth paragraph in this section.

   # The characters in certain scripts are written from right to left
   # In some documents, in particular those written with the Arabic or
   # Hebrew script, and in some mixed-language contexts, text in a single
   # (visually displayed) block may appear with mixed directionality.
   # This phenomenon is called bidirectionality, or "bidi" for short.
   #
   # The Unicode standard ([UNICODE], section 3.11) defines a complex
   # algorithm for determining the proper directionality of text. The
   # algorithm consists of an implicit part based on character properties,
   # as well as explicit controls for embeddings and overrides. CSS 2.1
   # relies on this algorithm to achieve proper bidirectional rendering.
   # The 'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties allow authors to
   # specify how the elements and attributes of a document language map
   # to this algorithm.

Strike the entire paragraph below:
   # If the rendered content contains right-to-left characters, and if
   # the user agent displays these characters in right-to-left order,
   # the user agent must apply the bidirectional algorithm. (UAs that
   # render right-to-left characters simply because a font on the system
   # contains them but do not support the concept of right-to-left text
   # direction are exempt from this requirement.)

Replace it with:

   | User agents that support bidirectional text must apply the Unicode
   | bidirectional algorithm to every sequence of inline boxes uninterrupted
   | by a forced line break or block boundary. This sequence forms the
   | "paragraph" unit in the bidirectional algorithm. The paragraph
   | embedding level is set according to the value of the 'direction'
   | property of the containing block rather than by the heuristic given
   | in steps P2 and P3 of the Unicode algorithm.

Description:
Richard Ishida was writing a tutorial on using language in CSS and had
trouble understanding the difference between :lang(x) and [lang|=x].

If he has trouble, than maybe others have, too. He suggested addding a
note to the spec to point out at least that the two selectors are
different. He was confused by the text that :lang worked "in the same
way" as |=.

Here is a possible text to add at the end of 5.11.4:

    *Note* the difference between [lang|=xx] and :lang(xx). In this
    HTML example, a rule for styling the paragraph for French would
    match the paragraph if the selector was 'p:lang(fr)', but
    'p[lang|=fr]' will not match against this paragraph.

        <body lang=fr>
          <p>Je suis fran&ccedil;ais.</p>
        </body>

Here is an alternative wording:

    *Note* the difference between [lang|=xx] and :lang(xx). In this
    HTML example, only the BODY matches [lang|=fr] (because it has a
    LANG attribute) but both the BODY and the P match :lang(fr)
    (because both are in French).

# does not apply to XHTML documents. 

make it clear at what position a canvas background is painted when it
comes from the root element ("anchored at the same point as..."), but do
not state the position used when it comes from the BODY element.  They
should do so.  I think it should be the same, but it's worth checking

The intention was that you'd use the computed values of the background
properties of the BODY element, but paint everything relative to the
HTML element, and do so across the entire canvas. In theory that's
what browsers have implemented, too. -Ian

Add "(for 'background-position')" after the first occurance of
"anchored".

Add "Such backgrounds must also be anchored at the same point as they
would be if they were painted only for the root element." between
"must not paint a background for that BODY element." and "This does

The CSS2.1 draft states that the baseline of an inline block is the

The problem is that the draft doesn't mention what to do if overflow
is hidden/auto/scroll (and I didn't think of it either). Similarly,
the first row of an inline table could be inside a scrolling table
body. Should overflow != visible cause the inline block to align on
its bottom margin edge always? Only if scrolled? Only if the last line
is clipped?

Another question I had was why use the first row for tables but the
last line for inline blocks? That seems completely inconsistent to me.

Lengths are inherited as absolute values, so the inner <div> doesn't
affect the answer to your question, thus it can't be 'sans-serif'. The
outer div's width doesn't change based on its contents, so the <span>
doesn't affect the answer either, so it can't be 'monospace'. This leaves
a MissingFont and 'serif'. Well it obviously can't be MissingFont since,
well, it's missing. Thus it must be 'serif'.

This isn't clear in CSS2.1. I suggest we change the following:

   The 'ex' unit is defined by the font's 'x-height'. The x-height is so
   called because it is often equal to the height of the lowercase "x".
   However, an 'ex' is defined even for fonts that don't contain an "x".

I don't like to tie the spec to any specific font technology, at least
not normatively, but TrueType could be mentioned as an example. For
example, in the following algorithm:

1) Look at the first available font in the list, i.e., the first font
that is available to the UA. If that font defines an x-height (e.g.,
sxHeight in OpenType and xheight in TFM), the UA must use that as the
'ex'.

2) If that font doesn't define an x-height, the UA should measure the
height of an "x", as it would be drawn if the element contained an "x".
(Note that that "x" may come from a later font in the list or from the
UA's fallback font.)

3) If it is not possible to measure the "x", a value of 0.45 em should
be used.

I think the first available font is the first font in the list that the
UA can read, independent of whether the element uses any glyphs from
it.

-Bert

Bert had an action to come up with some text and came up with these
two alternatives:

   http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2005OctDec/0063
   http://www.w3.org/mid/200511071925.10288.bert@w3.org

The latter is:

   The 'ex' unit is defined by the font's 'x-height'. The x-height is
   so called because it is often equal to the height of the lowercase
   "x".  However, an 'ex' is defined even for fonts that don't contain
   an "x".
  
   UAs must follow the following algorithm to establish the 'ex' for a
   given element:
  
      1. Using the algorithm for font selection (section 15.2), find
         the font that would be used for rendering an "x".
  
      2. Set the 'ex' to the x-height defined by that font; or draw
         the "x" (in an off-screen buffer) and measure its height.
  
      3. If it is impossible to find an x-height or measure an "x"
         glyph, use 0.5em.
  
   UAs should take care that the 'ex' they compute in step 2 is
   reasonable.  In many fonts, the height of an "x" is not equal to
   the x-height (e.g., because the x has a decorative flourish). On
   the other hand, experience shows that many fonts don't define an
   x-height or define it incorrectly.

Ian responded to the first of these with a suggestion to change the
following paragraph now in the spec:

   The 'ex' unit is defined by the font's 'x-height'. The x-height is so
   called because it is often equal to the height of the lowercase "x".
   However, an 'ex' is defined even for fonts that don't contain an "x".

...to read:

   The 'ex' unit is defined by the element's first available font's
   'x-height' metric. The element's first available font is the one that
   is found using <a>the font matching algorithm</a>, but without limiting
   the search to fonts that contain particular characters.

   The x-height is so called because it is often equal to the height of
   the lowercase "x". However, an 'ex' is defined even for fonts that
   don't contain an "x". User agent should use font metrics or direct
   glyph measurement if possible, but may fall back on a default of 0.5em
   if the first available font does not contain suitable information.

Ian responded to the second of Bert's ideas above with:

> This would work too. It differs from the alternative proposal in that
> it uses the 'ex' height of the first font _with an x_, rather than
> the first available font. Is that what we want?

To which Bert replied:

That's what I gathered from the minutes:
http://www.w3.org/2005/10/17-css-irc.html#T22-09-17

I think the argument was that, if you use an ex and there is an x in the
content, you would want the two to match. Plus, UAs already know how to
search the font list for the font with an x.

I think that's reasonable, and it made the algorithm nice and short. But
I'm open for suggestions.

Section 4.3.6

Could you specify that users agents may perform higher quality mapping
of colours from one gamut to another? Specifying that they should be
clipped will produce poor results when the output colour space is not
'close' to sRGB, such as a CMYK printer.

For example User Agents may use a process that provides mapping of the
gamut to the device gamut in other ways, such as perceptual or
photometric gamut mapping. This may involve compressing the full gamut
of colours to fit inside the gamut of the output device, rather than
simply clipping those outside the gamut so as to provide a better
visual output. Please allow conformant UA's to perform higher quality
gamut mapping.

Also please specify late clipping of colours as per CSS 2.0. Thus
preserving colours until the final rendering step. This will also
facilitate better colour quality.

-SVG

<Bert> I think the answer is that remapping is not possible without
knowing what gamut the colors were chosen for in the first place
(although it is probably a good guess that colors in an '@media
screen' style sheet are meant for an RGB monitor).
<Bert> There is a property 'rendering-intent' in CSS3 Color, which may
help with remapping.

Resolution:

Insert "Users agents may perform higher quality mapping of colors from
one gamut to another." just before the sentence that starts with "For
a typical CRT monitor...".
Then change "clipped" at the end of the section to "mapped".

Issue 126.
Description:

4.1.5 is clear that "CSS 2.1 user agents must ignore any '@import'
rule that occurs inside a block or after any valid rule other than an
@charset or an @import rule.", ever since we agreed to say this as
part of CSS2.1 issues-2 issue 82.

Thus, UA requirements are clear.

However, section 6.3 says "Any @import rules must precede all rule
sets in a style sheet.", which is for the author point of view but is
not as clear.

I propose we change that sentence in 6.3 to read "Any @import rules
must precede all other rules (except the @charset rule, if present)."

inside an @media block. Oops.)

Description:

(See also empty-cells in issue 62)

http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#table-layers

This example seems to be demonstrating two things:
   - what to do if a cell is empty and empty-cells is 'hide'
   - what to do if a cell is completely missing

The first case is well-defined in CSS2.1, but the second
doesn't seem to be defined at all.

I propose that missing cells be treated, for the purpose
of rendering, as empty cells with all properties (notably
including border and background) except 'emtpy-cells' set
at their default values and "empty-cells: hide". This will
make sure handling in collapsed border tables defined, and
will make sure the cells effectively disappear in the
separated borders model. It's also compatible with what I
perceive to be CSS2's take on the problem. (See the last
rule in 17.5.1 in CSS2.)

-Elika

Resolution:

Add the following paragraph right after the list and before the
paragraph following the list in section 17.5:

   A "missing cell" is a cell in the row/column grid that is not
   occupied by an element or pseudo-element. Missing cells are
   rendered as if an anonymous table-cell box occupied their position
   in the grid.

Description:
I think 6.4.1 needs to be clearer about the sort at each step being
only within groups of rules that sorted equivalent to each other at
the previous step...  That's not obvious from just looking at the
text, as things stand. -Boris

howcome says:

I propose to change this text in 6.4.1 from:

   To find the value for an element/property combination, user agents
   must apply the following sorting order:

to:

   To find the value for an element/property combination, user agents
   must use the following pseudo-algorithm:

and add this paragraph after the numbered list:

   The sorting process continues until one winning declaration is found.


dbaron disagreed and proposed:

Change the start of (2) from "Sort" to "Choose the last declaration in
the sort".

Change the start of (3) from "Sort" to "If the previous sort resulted in
a tie, break the tie by choosing the highest declaration in the sort".

Change the start of (4) from "Finally, sort by order specified: if two
rules have the same weight, origin and specificity," to "Finally, if the
previous sort still resulted in a tie,".

David also proposed:

Choose the declarations at the highest numerical value in the
following list based on importance (normal or important) and origin
(author, user, or user agent):

   1. user agent style sheets
   2. user normal style sheets
   3. author normal style sheets
   4. author important style sheets
   5. user important style sheets

If this results in more than one declaration, choose the
declarations tied for the highest specificity of selector.
Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are counted as normal elements and
classes, respectively.

If this results in more than one declaration, break the tie with
order:  the latter specified wins. Rules in imported style sheets are
considered to be before any rules in the style sheet itself.


Resolution:

Replace 2 with "2. Sort according to importance (normal or important)
and origin (author, user, or user agent). In ascending order of
precendence:"

Insert "rules with the same importance and origin" after "3. Sort"

So you can't have url(/**/foo/**/) or !/**/important (or you can have

former and allows the latter. Anne says iCab, IE win/mac, and Gecko do

Description:

  CSS 2.1 has http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#escaped-characters

  Third, backslash escapes allow authors to refer to characters they
  can't easily put in a document. In this case, the backslash is
  followed by at most six hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which stand for
  the ISO 10646 ([ISO10646]) character with that number, which must not
  be zero. (It is undefined in CSS 2.1 what happens if a style sheet
  does contain a zero.)

I think at least the second instance of "zero" is misleading, this
should probably be ... which must not be U+0000 ... does contain a
U+0000 ... though there might be better wording for it. It also notes

  Backslash escapes are always considered to be part of an identifier
  or a string (i.e., "\7B" is not punctuation, even though "{" is, and
  "\32" is allowed at the start of a class name, even though "2" is
  not).

That doesn't seem right as if the escape is not part of STRING or IDENT
tokens as defined in the tokenization, it cannot be considered part of
any. This basically says that unescaping happens conceptually after
parsing and that escapes may occur in places where the literal character
would not be allowed. I am not sure how to rephrase it (nor does it seem
to be needed) though.

Resolution:
=Bert= Edit the first of the above to be clearer that by "zero" we
mean the unicode character zero; prepend the word "Note:" at the
beginning of the second paragraph he's complaining about, and maybe
add ", where allowed, " between "escapes" and "are".

URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/43C68B95.4070405@mit.edu
Description:

I'm trying to understand the following paragraph in section 11.1.1 [1]:

  In the case of a scrollbar being placed on an edge of the element's box, it
  should be inserted between the inner border edge and the outer padding edge.
  Any space taken up by the scrollbars should be subtracted from the computed
  width/height, thus preserving the inner border edge.

What does that mean in practice?  Specifically, consider the following markup:

  <div id="outer">
    <div id="inner">Text</div>
  </div>

And the styles

  #outer { overflow: auto; height: 200px; width: 200px;}
  #inner { height: 100%; width: 200%; }

Now the "outer" div overflows horizontally, so a horizontal scrollbar
has to be inserted.  Given that, what is the computed value of
"height" for the outer div?  Is it 100px?  Or is it (100px - 'height
of scrollbar')?  And more specifically, what is the computed value of
"height" for the inner div?

Resolution:

The computed value of the outer 'height' is 200px.
The computed value of the inner 'height' is 100%.

Proposal:

10.3.3: Change 

   'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' +
   'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' = width of
   containing block

   If 'width' is not 'auto' and 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' +
   'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width'

...to:

   'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' +
   'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' + scrollbar
   width (if any) = width of containing block

   If 'width' is not 'auto' and 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' +
   'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + scrollbar width
   (if any)

Add to the end of that section:

   The "scrollbar width" value is only relevant if the user agent uses
   a scrollbar as its scrolling mechanism. See the definition of the
   'overflow' property.

10.3.7: Change:

   'left' + 'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' +
   'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' +
   'right' = width of containing block

...to:

   'left' + 'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' +
   'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' +
   'right' + scrollbar width (if any) = width of containing block

Add to the end of that section:

   The "scrollbar width" value is only relevant if the user agent uses
   a scrollbar as its scrolling mechanism. See the definition of the
   'overflow' property.

10.6.4: (tbd...)

10.6.6: (tbd...)

Change 11.1.1:

   In the case of a scrollbar being placed on an edge of the element's
   box, it should be inserted between the inner border edge and the
   outer padding edge. Any space taken up by the scrollbars should be
   subtracted from the computed width/height, thus preserving the
   inner border edge.

Issue 151.
Description:

I was just rereading the CSS 2.1 spec and believe I stumbled across a
typo in the Flex tokenizer.

string1   \"([^\n\r\f\\"]|\\{nl}|{escape})*\"
string2   \'([^\n\r\f\\']|\\{nl}|{escape})*\'
invalid1   \"([^\n\r\f\\"]|\\{nl}|{escape})*
invalid2   \'([^\n\r\f\\']|\\{nl}|{escape})*

In the first part of these rules, shouldn't there be one more or one
less backslash before the single and double quotes? For example:

(a) if a lone backslash is to be forbidden:  [^\n\r\f\\\"]
(b) if a lone backslash is to be allowed:    [^\n\r\f\"]

I would think that option (a) is what's intended. I didn't see
anything about this in the changes/errata. Could you please confirm?

Nice work on the spec, btw.

Thanks,
Jared

Based on previous discussion [1], I think it's clear the ::first-line
pseudo-element is badly underspecified and further that there is no
clear idea how to specify it.  Given the state it's in, I don't think
it's possible to implement it interoperably.

Given that, I request that ::first-line be removed from the CSS2.1
specification until such a time as it's better specified.

Tantek's proposal:

Put the ::first-line pseudo inside the inline elements.
Paint the background separately, as for an anonymous box around the
contents of the first line.

Which background do you use, if ::first-line says "background: inherit"?
What do you report for getComputedStyle(element, "::first-line") ?

Anne van Kesteren raised as a last-call comment on WICD [1] regarding
the sizing of scalable SVG background images (i.e., those that do not
provide a size, and may or may not provide an intrinsic ratio).  The CDF
working group discussed this and concluded [2] that it would be best if
this were specified by CSS.

Resolution:

In section 14.2 add:

   Intrinsic dimensions expressed as percentages must be resolved
   relative to the dimensions of the rectangle that establishes the
   coordinate system for the background-position property.

   If the image has no intrinsic dimensions and has an intrinsic ratio
   the dimensions must be assumed to be the largest dimensions at that
   ratio such that neither dimension exceeds the dimensions of the
   rectangle that establishes the coordinate system for the
   background-position property.

   If the image has no intrinsic ratio either, then the dimensions
   must be assumed to be the rectangle that establishes the coordinate
   system for the background-position property.

  The CSS text is sketchy on the issue of line breaks.  Is a float a
  line break opportunity?

  This came up accidentally in composing a test page where I had
  something like:

                          Blah blah blah<span style="float: left">foo foo foo</span>, more blah blah blah

  So there is no space between the 'blah' before the span and the ','
  afterward.

  Should a browser (formatting English just to avoid any
  language-specific issues) ever allow a line break between the word and
  the comma?  Visually, if you have some construct like:

                          Xxx<span style="font: sans-serif">yyy</span>zzz

  The xxx, yyy and zzz sub-sequences may appear very different, but I
  could not find a browser that would line break that sequence.  Yet, I
  did find that FireFox 1.5 (I think) does line break at a float.

  What is the correct behavior?  There is language in the spec that says
  floats should have no effect on vertical layout (relating to block
  elements in the same flow), but I find no equivalent statement about
  inline elements and text in the same flow.

bz's suggestions was:

   If 'height' has a computed value of 'auto', 'width' also has a
   computed value of 'auto', and the element has an intrinsic height,
   the intrinsic height is the used value of 'height'.

...and analogously for width.

Description:
 - font fallback seems restricted to only one font
 - Paul notes that UA should be free to pick using any algorithm
 - UA should be able to do something more intelligent than using the
   missing glyph glyph; e.g. print box with Unicode hex code
 - Elika notes that UA should try at least one UA-chosen font before
   falling back to default glyphs because even though all fonts on system
   have required glyph, author may have specified a list of fonts that
   aren't on the system,

Resolved:

In section 5.2 replace point 5 with:
   5. If there is no font within the family selected in 2, then use a
   UA-dependent default 'font-family' and repeat step 2, using the best
   match that can be obtained within the default font. If a particular
   character cannot be displayed using this font, the the UA may use other
   means to determine a suitable font for that character. The UA should map
   each character for which it has no suitable font to a visible symbol
   chosen by the UA, preferably a "missing character" glyph from one of the
   font faces available to the UA.
