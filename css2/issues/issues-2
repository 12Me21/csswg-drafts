Issue 1.
Description:
Need to add something somewhere to make it clear that vertical margins
on inline elements have no effect and can be ignored.
Resolution:
Add to the definition of "'margin-top', 'margin-bottom'", after the
property table (section 8.3):
| <p class="note">These properties have no effect on non-replaced inline
| elements.</p>
Issue closed.

Issue 2.
Section: 7.3 Recognized media types
Description:
The spec says:
# Media types are mutually exclusive in the sense that a user agent
# can only support one media type when rendering a document. However,
# user agents may have different modes which support different media
# types.
This makes print-preview non-conformant according to some people.
Resolution:
Accepted.
Internal resolution:
Use text based on these:

<Hixie> Media types are mutually exclusive in the sense that a user agent
<Hixie> can only support one media type per canvas when rendering a
<Hixie> document. Multimodal media types use one canvas. However, user
<Hixie> agents may have different modes which support different media types.
<Hixie>
<Hixie> For example, the 'tv' media type's canvas has an X axis, a Y axis,
<Hixie> and a speech axis, but printing implies two canvases: the screen
<Hixie> canvas, and the print canvas.

<fantasai> Media types are mutually exclusive in the sense that
<fantasai> a user agent can only support one media type per canvas
<fantasai> when rendering a document. However, user agents may have
<fantasai> different modes which support different media types.
<fantasai> Note a multimodal media type is still only one media type.
<fantasai> The 'tv' media type, for example, has an x axis, a y axis,
<fantasai> and a speech axis all as part of a single canvas. Printing,
<fantasai> however, implies two canvases: the screen canvas and the
<fantasai> print canvas.

nesting for quotes." with "Introduces no content, but increments
(decrements) the level of nesting for quotes."

Issue 6.
Section: 17.6.2 The collapsing border model
URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/Pine.LNX.4.58.0402230022480.13400@dhalsim.dreamhost.com
Description:
We seem to be a little vague on where the table background extends to.

For example, with:

   <table>             table { background: yellow; border: 0.5em solid;
                               border-collapse: collapse; }
    <tr> <td/> </tr>   tr           > td { border: 2em dotted; }
    <tr> <td/> </tr>   tr + tr      > td { border: 1em dotted; }
    <tr> <td/> </tr>   tr + tr + tr > td { border: 3em dotted; }
   </table>

Where does the yellow background go on the second row? There seems to
be only a few options (assuming that later rows coming in
incrementally shouldn't cause the background in earlier rows to
suddenly change extent or origin):

1. Having it extend outside the table on row 2, and only extend
   through half the border on row 3 (i.e. extend as far as the first
   row's border). This is the only option that will look ugly if the
   borders are solid -- the other options all look fine if the border
   is solid.
   http://www.damowmow.com/temp/csswg/css21/issues-cr-issue6-case1

2. Having it extend to half way through the border in all three cases.
   Always looks ugly. Means there is no way to put a background behind
   the complete border of a normal table.
   http://www.damowmow.com/temp/csswg/css21/issues-cr-issue6-case2
   Implemented by: Mozilla (strict mode), Safari, MSN Mac.

3. Having it extend to the table's computed border-width. In this
   case, it would extend 1.25em into the first row's border, 0.75em
   into the second, and 1.75em into the third. That's a straight line,
   half the table's computed border-width from the grid line.
   Simplifies to option 2 when only the cells have borders (not the
   table itself) which is quite common.
   http://www.damowmow.com/temp/csswg/css21/issues-cr-issue6-case3
   Implemented by: Opera.

4. Having it extend to the each row's border edge. This would result
   in an uneven background edge and probably be hard to implement, not
   to mention being an issue with images. It looks cool though. For
   some people.
   http://www.damowmow.com/temp/csswg/css21/issues-cr-issue6-case4

5. Another?
   Implemented by: Mozilla (quirks mode)

Note that case 3 can actually do the effect of case 2, so it is the
most flexible. The other cases can only do their own rendering, and
can't be tweaked to look like the others.

Resolution:
Add the following at the end of 17.6.2 before "Border conflict
resolution":
"CSS2.1 does not define where the edge of a background on a
table element lies."
=hyatt= Edit CSS3 Tables.

URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/20040224045752.GA32622@darby.dbaron.org
Resolution:
Change section 4.4 from:
# very start of the style sheet, not preceded by any characters,
# except possibly a "BOM" (U+FEFF).
...to:
| very start of the style sheet or immediately after a Byte Order Mark
| (BOM, U+FEFF) that is at the very start of the style sheet.

Change "should not" to "must not" in:
# Unknown media type names should not result in the @media rule being
# ignored.
Issue closed.

Issue 12.
Section: 4.1.3 Characters and case
Description:

This text could definitely be made easier to understand:

# In CSS 2.1, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs
# in selectors) can contain only the characters [A-Za-z0-9] and ISO
# 10646 characters U+00A1 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the
# underscore (_); they cannot start with a digit. Only properties,
# values, units, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, and at-rules may
# start with a hyphen (-); other identifiers (e.g. element names,
# classes, or IDs) may not.

To highlight the relevant parts:

# In CSS 2.1, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs
# in selectors) can contain [...] the hyphen [...]. Only [...] may
# start with a hyphen (-); other identifiers (e.g. element names,
# classes, or IDs) may not.

Sure, the text is technically correct, but...

Proposal:
Just strike the first "(including element names, classes, and IDs in
selectors)".

Resolution:
Emphasise the second occurance of "start" in:
# In CSS 2.1, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs
# in selectors) can contain only the characters [A-Za-z0-9] and ISO
# 10646 characters U+00A1 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the
# underscore (_); they cannot start with a digit. Only properties,
# values, units, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, and at-rules may
# start with a hyphen (-); other identifiers (e.g. element names,
# classes, or IDs) may not.

Issue 14.
Section: 16.6 Whitespace: the 'white-space' property
Description:
The link in:
# This property declares how _whitespace_ inside the element is handled.
...should be removed (it links to the grammar definition of
whitespace!).
Resolution:
Agreed.
Issue closed.

Issue 15.
Description:
Kimberly should either be an editor or an acknowledged.
Resolution:

Issue 16.
Section: 16.6.1 The 'white-space' processing model, step 1
Description:
# Each non-linefeed whitespace character surrounding a linefeed
# character is removed if 'white-space' is set to 'normal', 'no-wrap',
# or 'pre-line'.
...should define "whitespace", or, better, just list which characters
it means. Ian thinks it is just U+0020 and U+0009.
Resolution:
Change the above paragraph in 16.6.1 The 'white-space' processing
model, step 1 to:
# Each tab (U+0009), carriage return (U+000D), or space (U+0020)
# character surrounding a linefeed (U+000A) character is removed if
# 'white-space' is set to 'normal', 'no-wrap', or 'pre-line'.

Issue 17.
Section: 12.5.1 Lists: the 'list-style-type', 'list-style-image', 'list-style-position', and 'list-style' properties
Description:
Should armenian, georgian, lower-greek be removed.
Resolution: 
Maybe.

Add, to the status section:

<h3>Features at risk</h3>
<p>The working group has identified the following features as being
currently poorly implemented by UAs. They are therefore most at risk
of being removed from CSS2.1 when exiting CR. (Any changes of this
nature will still result in the specification being returned to last
call.) Implementors are urged to implement these features, or correct
bugs in their implementations, if they wish to see this feature remain
in this specification.</p>
<dl>
 <dt>New 'list-style-type' values</dt>
 <dd>
  <ul>
   <li>'armenian'</li>
   <li>'georgian'</li>
   <li>'lower-greek'</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Implementors should look at CSS3 Lists instead, where these and
  many other new values not found in CSS1 are defined in detail.
  [[CSS3LISTS]]</p>

Remove from 12.5.1:
# A user agent that does not recognize a numbering system should use
# 'decimal'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 18.
Description:
<fantasai> There's a section that says that margins, borders, and
padding of /non-replaced/ elements do /not/ enter into the line box
calculation, but I can't find the section that says margins, borders,
and padding on replaced elements do.
<dbaron> This is clear in CSS1, section 4.4, paragraph 5: "Replaced
elements (e.g. images) on the line can make the line-box bigger, if
the top of the replaced element (i.e., including all of its padding,
border and margin) is above the tallest text section, or if the bottom
is below the lowest."
Resolution:

Edit "10.6.1 Inline, non-replaced elements":

| But only the 'line-height' is used to calculate the height of the
| line box.

...to:

| But only the 'line-height' is used when calculating the height of
| the line box.

Add to "10.6.2 Inline replaced elements, block-level replaced elements
in normal flow, 'inline-block' replaced elements in normal flow and
floating replaced elements":

| For 'inline' and 'inline-block' elements, the margin box is used when
| calculating the height of the line box.

Add to "10.6.6 Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow when
'overflow' does not compute to 'visible'; 'inline-block', non-replaced
elements; and floating, non-replaced elements":

| For 'inline-block' elements, the margin box is used when calculating
| the height of the line box.

Issue 19. http://www.w3.org/mid/3F875337.6080406@escape.com
Section: 5.8.2 Default Attributes
Description:
#    EXAMPLE { /*... default property settings ...*/ }
# Because this selector is less specific than an attribute selector,
# it will only be used for the default case.
This is false. The selector will be used for all cases, not just the
default case. If a declaration from this rule conflicts with one from
a more specific rule, then it will be overridden--but the declaration
still applies.
Resolution:
Replace the entire example in 5.8.2 Default Attributes with the
example in:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2004Feb/0391.html
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 20. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2003Nov/0021.html
Section: 16.6.2 Example of bidirectionality with white-space collapsing
Description:
This is wrong:
# This is best avoided by using the natural bidirectionality of
# characters instead of explicit embedding levels.
Richard Ishida was looking at this.
Resolution:
Replace the above with:
"This can sometimes be avoided by using the natural bidirectionality
of characters instead of explicit embedding levels. Also, it is good
to avoid spaces immediately inside start and end tags, as these tend
to do weird things when dealing with white space collapsing."
=fantasai= If that isn't good enough, please provide examples and
we'll open a new issue.

Issue 21. 
Section: 4.4 CSS style sheet representation

Issue 22.
Section: 3.2 Conformance
Description:
It's unclear that CSS requires that UAs let authors disable all author
stylesheets.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 23.
Section: 4.1.3 Characters and case
Description:
# backslash escapes allow authors to refer to characters they can't
# easily put in a document. In this case, the backslash is followed by
# at most six hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which stand for the ISO
# 10646 ([ISO10646]) character with that number, which must not be
# zero.
So what if it _is_ zero? What does that parse as?
Resolution:
Add a warning note in CSS2.1.
In CSS3, say that \0 (an escape of character 0) is simply ignored, so
blockquote and block\0quote are exactly equivalent.
=dbaron= Edit CSS3.

Issue 24.
URI: http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=182748
URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/20050223233244.GA555@ridley.dbaron.org
Description:
I suspect the spec should probably be changed to
add the paragraph that's in 10.3.3:

  If 'width' is not 'auto' and 'border-left-width' +
  'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' +
  'border-right-width' (plus any of 'margin-left' or
  'margin-right' that are not 'auto') is larger than
  the width of the containing block, then any 'auto'
  values for 'margin-left' or 'margin-right' are, for
  the following rules, treated as zero.

...to other places.
dbaron has sent further details, see second URI.
Resolution:
Change the text within 10.3.7:

# If both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are 'auto', solve the
# equation under the extra constraint that the two margins get equal
# values.

to be:

: If both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are 'auto', solve the
: equation under the extra constraint that the two margins get equal
: values, unless this would make them negative, in which case when
: direction is 'ltr' ('rtl'), set 'margin-left' ('margin-right') to zero
: and solve for 'margin-right' ('margin-left').

And change the text within 10.3.8:

# 4. If at this point both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are still
# 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two
# margins must get equal values. 

to be:

: 4. If at this point both 'margin-left' and 'margin-right' are still
: 'auto', solve the equation under the extra constraint that the two
: margins must get equal values, unless this would make them negative,
: in which case when direction is 'ltr' ('rtl'), set 'margin-left'
: ('margin-right') to zero and solve for 'margin-right' ('margin-left').

Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 25.
Description:
howcome says the text for "Used values" is a bit arcane.
Resolution:
Edit to say:
  Computed values are processed as far as possible without formatting
  the document. Some values, however, can only be determined when the
  document is being laid out. For example, if the width of an element is
  set to be a certain percentage of its containing block, the width
  cannot be determined until the width of the containing block has been
  determined. The <dfn id="usedValue">used value</dfn> is the result of
  taking the computed value and resolving any remaining dependencies
  into an absolute value.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 26.
Section: 11.1.2 Clipping: the 'clip' property
Description:
We forgot to update the intro text. It still says:
# By default, the clipping region has the same size and shape as the
# element's border box.
It should say:
# By default, the element is not clipped.
Issue closed,
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 27.
Description:

and "upper-alpha" aren't listed formally.
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 28.
Description:
There is a diagram in the text-decoration section that became out of
sync with the prose during editing.
Resolution:
Update text so that the sentence in "16.3.1 Underlining,
overlining, striking, and blinking: the 'text-decoration' property"
that reads "The <em>text</em> in the em block is not underlined at
all, as it is not contained in the same anonymous inline element." is
changed to read "The <em>text</em> in the em block is also underlined,
as it is in an in-flow block to which the underline is propagated."
(or similar) then update the image to be:
   http://www.damowmow.com/temp/csswg/css21/underline-example.png
Issue closed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue 29.
Description:
empty-cells is too vaguely specified. Does a zero-height zero-width
image could as visible content? What if it is display:inline and thus
creates a line box? What about an empty block with no background,
border, padding, height, or width? What about... etc.
Proposal:
A cell is empty if it contains nothing but the whitespace characters
currently listed _and_ white-space would collapse those characters so
that they don't form a line box. Any other textual or element content
counts as visible content. (I assume we don't have to say anything
about PIs or comments, I mean, those obviously don't affect rendering
right? -Ian)

<Hixie> "cells are empty if they contain no in-flow nor floating
content other than whitespace that has been collapsed away by the
white-space property handling"?

Tests: http://www.hixie.ch/tests/adhoc/css/box/table/empty-cells/

Resolution:
Accepted.

Change this text in 17.6.1:

# Visible content includes "&nbsp;" and other whitespace except ASCII
# CR ("\0D"), LF ("\0A"), tab ("\09"), and space ("\20").

...so that it says:

  Cells are empty unless they contain one or more of the following:
    * floating content (including empty elements),
    * in-flow content (including empty elements) other than whitespace
      that has been collapsed away by the white-space property handling.

(Group agreed that cells are empty if they contain no in-flow nor
floating content other than whitespace that has been collapsed away by
the white-space property handling.)

Issue 30.
Description:
From CSSWG telecon minutes:
     "explicitly state somewhere in media.html that unknown
      identifiers are parseable in media lists (e.g.

Issue 31.
URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/20040412233323.GA5478@darby.dbaron.org
Description:
I think it should be specified what happens when a stylesheet
specifies the same counter more than once in the value of the
'counter-increment' and 'counter-reset' properties. -dbaron
(See URI for details.)
Resolution:
They all get applied (so for counter-reset, the last one takes
effect).
Specifically, replace:

  If the same counter is specified more than once in the value of the
  'counter-reset' and 'counter-increment' properties, all counters are
  processed in the order specified.

...with:

  If the same counter is specified more than once in the value of the
  'counter-reset' and 'counter-increment' properties, each mention of
  the counter is processed (in the order specified).

Issue 32.
URI: http://www.w3.org/mid/1940625.20040411235142@w3.org
Description:
Alfonso Martinez pointed out that according to the CSS 2.1
recommendation, lower-greek is an alphabetic system, not a
numbering system, which -- to my surprise -- is true.

As is clear, from my bug report filing, lower-greek should be
reclassified as a numbering system, and handled accordingly,
by www browsers.
Resolution:
Keep lower-greek as alphabetic; in CSS3 we may have 'greek', if
someone can give us an algorithm.

consist" to "The minimal height consists". In "10.8 Line height
calculations: the 'line-height' and 'vertical-align' properties", add
a fourth list item that is:
  <li>If the resulting height is smaller than the minimal height of

(From: Felipe Gasper <fgasper@freeshell.org>)

I am designing a web application for managing accounting data. To
prevent users from "instinctively" holding SHIFT to capitalize, I am
capitalizing all text displayed in form elements (input[type='text']
{text-transform: uppercase}). This, of course, has no effect on the
*actual* data passed to the application server.

This technique works in Gecko and IE, but KHTML (both Konqueror and
Safari) ignores this CSS property of the <input> tag, presumably
because, technically, this is not "enclosed" text as the specification
seems to point out.

Perhaps some stipulation should be added to the CSS spec regarding
this useful property?

Resolution:

Specification says:
# CSS2.1 does not define which properties apply to form controls and
# frames

...which is good enough.

1. Recomended line-height

The default style sheet for HTML contains this:
  body { line-height: 1.12 }.
But what all popular UAs use is  line-height: 1.2  -isn't it?
This sentence about line-height (section 10.8.1)
  "We recommend a used value for 'normal' between 1.0 to 1.2."
should be matched to the recomended value of appendix D.

Description:
2. Recomended font-size of headings, scaling factors for font-size

There are significant differences between appendix D and section 15.7.
The font-sizes of headings don't match.

section 15.7
font-size      xx-small x-small small  medium  large  x-large xx-large
<font size>    1                2       3      4       5        6
heading        h6       --      h5      h4     h3      h2       h1
scaling factor 0.60     0.75    0.89    1.0    1.20    1.50     2.0
appendix D     0.75em   --      0.83em  1.0em  1.17em  1.50em   2.0em

And think on something like this:
<body style="font-size:40px">
<h2 style="font-size:x-large">heading</h2>
<p>text</p>
On an average screen this h2 may have a font size of 24px, while the
text is larger. Headings should be sized relatively, like in appendix D,
and not absolutely, like section 15.7. may suggest. Throw it out here,
it's confusing.

I don't like the scaling factors of section 15.7. Is this really a
reflection of current implementations? 0.89 seems me to big and 0.60 to
small.

This may be a consistent compromise:
section 15.7
font-size      xx-small x-small small  medium  large  x-large xx-large
<font size>     1       --      2       3      4       5        6
scaling factor  0.60    0.72    0.85    1.0    1.20    1.50     2.0
appendix D              h6      h5      h4     h3      h2       h1
font-size               0.72em  0.85em  1.0em  1.20em  1.50em   2.0em

Or this range:  0.62    0.73    0.85    1.0    1.17    1.5      2.0

Proposed Resolution (Boston F2F):
Remove the HTML headings row of the table in 15.7 and remove the
mention of headings in the paragraph before it.
Disagreed by Tantek.

Description:
  3. The grammar in Appendix G.1 states that function values
     may be prefixed with a unary operator, that is, '+' or '-'.
     But with the introduction of identifiers that start with '-',
     it will no longer be possible to prefix functions with '-'.
     Any attempt to do so will only cause the '-' to be considered
     part of the function name. In other words, this syntax:
       -myfunc(x)
     will be tokenized as:
       FUNCTION, IDENT, ')'
     rather than
       '-', FUNCTION, IDENT, ')'

     As far as I know there are no functions in CSS 2.1 that it would
     make sense to prefix with a minus sign, but apparently such functions
     (representing length values, for example) may be introduced in CSS3?
     (Note, that it will not help to say that function names cannot start
      with '-', because the tokenizer will still see the '-' as part of
      the identifier, and the example above will yield:
        IDENT, '(', IDENT, ')'
      which will likely cause a parsing error.)

Description:
  4. Another change in the lexical scanner in CSS 2.1 is that some tokens
     are defined to include their preceding white space (for example LBRACE).
     This, together with the change that the production 'simple_selector'
     no longer ends with S*, means that, for example, the following syntax
     is no longer valid:
        P  /* A comment */  { color: red }
     because this will tokenize as:
        IDENT, S, LBRACE, S, IDENT, ':', S, IDENT, S, '}'
     and the grammar does not allow the first S. (According to section
     4.1.9, comments only occur between tokens, so the space before the
     comment will not be seen as part of the LBRACE token.)

specified in section 3.1, but it is marked as being "important."

Also, it's not clear to which specific style sheet(s) the "certain style

all author, UA default, or particular referenced style sheets.

Issue 98.
Description:
(This is a requirement from the CDF group.)
If a replaced element has no intrinsic dimensions then rendering is
undefined. We should say there is a default, so that rendering of such
cases are defined. (e.g. text/plain objects)
I suggest 300px width, with the height derived from the intrinsic
ratio, and, if there isn't one, defaulting to height 150px. -Ian

Resolution:

Replace CSS 2.1 section 10.3.2 "Inline, replaced elements" with:

   A computed value of 'auto' for 'margin-left' or 'margin-right'
   becomes a used value of '0'.

   If 'width' has a computed value of 'auto' and 'height' also has a
   computed value of 'auto', the element's intrinsic width is the used
   value of 'width', if it has one.

   If 'width' has a computed value of 'auto' and 'height' has some
   other computed value, and the replaced element has an intrinsic
   ratio, or, if both 'width' and 'height' have computed values of
   'auto', and the element has no intrinsic width but does have an
   intrinsic height and intrinsic ratio, then the used value of
   'width' is:

     (intrinsic ratio) * (used height)

   Otherwise, if 'width' has a computed value of 'auto', but none of
   the conditions above are met, then the used value of 'width'
   becomes 300px. If 300px is too wide to fit the device, UAs should
   use the width of the largest rectangle that has a 2:1 ratio and
   fits the device instead.

   Percentage intrinsic widths are first evaluated with respect to the
   containing block's width, if that width doesn't itself depend on
   the replaced element's width. If it does, then a percentage
   intrinsic width on that element can't be resolved and the element
   is assumed to have no intrinsic width.

Replace CSS 2.1 section 10.6.2 "Inline replaced elements, block-level
replaced elements in normal flow, 'inline-block' replaced elements in
normal flow and floating replaced elements" with the following:

   If 'margin-top', or 'margin-bottom' are 'auto', their used value is
   0.

   If 'height' has a computed value of 'auto' and 'width' also has a
   computed value of 'auto', the element's intrinsic height is the
   used value of 'height', it has one.

   If 'height' has a computed value of 'auto' and 'width' has some
   other computed value, and the replaced element has an intrinsic
   ratio, or, if both 'height' and 'width' have computed values of
   'auto', and the element has no intrinsic height but does have an
   intrinsic width and intrinsic ratio, then the used value of
   'height' is:

    (used width) / (intrinsic ratio)

   Otherwise, if 'height' has a computed value of 'auto', but none of
   the conditions above are met, then the used value of 'height' must
   be set to 150px. If 300px is too wide to fit the device width, UAs
   should use the height of the largest rectangle that has a 2:1 ratio
   and fits the device width instead.

   Percentage intrinsic heights are evaluated with respect to the
   containing block's height, if that height is specified explicitly,
   or if the replaced element is absolutely positioned. If neither of
   these conditions is met, then percentage values on such replaced
   elements can't be resolved and such elements are assumed to have no
   intrinsic height.

   For 'inline' and 'inline-block' elements, the margin box is used
   when calculating the height of the line box.

Replace the definition of "Replaced element" in section 3.1
"Definitions" with:

   An element that is outside the scope of the CSS formatter, such as
   an image, embedded document, or applet. For example, the content of
   the HTML IMG element is often replaced by the image that its "src"
   attribute designates. Replaced elements often have intrinsic
   dimensions: an intrinsic width, an intrinsic height, and an
   intrinsic ratio. For example, a bitmap image has an intrinsic width
   and an intrinsic height specified in absolute units (from which the
   intrinsic ratio can obviously be determined). On the other hand,
   other documents may not have any intrinsic dimensions (for example
   a blank HTML document).

   User agents may consider a replaced element to not have any
   intrinsic dimensions if it is believed that those dimensions could
   leak sensitive information to a third party. For example, if an
   HTML document changed intrinsic size depending on the user's bank
   balance, then the UA might want to act as if that resource had no
   intrinsic dimensions.

U+0020 (space), and U+202x (bidi formatting characters) are treated as
characters to render in the same way as any normal character.</p>

<p>Combining characters should be treated as part of the character
with which they are supposed to combine. For example, :first-letter
styles the entire glyph if you have content like
"<code>o&lt;span&gt;&amp;#x308;&lt;/span&gt;</code>"; it doesn't just
match the base character.</p>

Description:
When an object is absolutely positioned using the 'bottom' and 'right'
properties and direction is ltr, step 2 of the current algorithm in
Section 10.3.8 seems to inappropriately set 'left' to the static
position when the intrinsic width of the object implies a different
left position. (Essentially the 'right' offset is overridden by
setting 'left' to the static position.) And the analogous issue for
rtl also applies, I believe. -MG

Description:
How is a replaced element with display:table-cell handled?
How about other display values?
[Fwiw, my personal preference from an implementation perspective is
that replaced elements with table-row-group, table-row, table-cell,
table-caption display values be treated as inlines and anonymous boxes
be constructed appropriately.... (read that as "Boris doesn't want to
rewrite all the table rendering code in Mozilla to not assume things
about the layout objects it's working with"). -Boris]

Resolution:
Add to 17.2, after the table display types list:
| Replaced elements with these 'display' values are treated as their
| given display types during layout. For example, an image that is set
| to 'display: table-cell' will fill the available cell space, and its
| dimensions might contribute towards the table sizing algorithms, as
| with an ordinary cell.

Description:
How to handle unterminated constructs (unexpected end of stylesheet)
is undefined.
Proposal from howcome and ian to add to section 4.2:

   Unexpected end of stylesheet.

   User agents must close all open constructs (blocks, parentheses,
   brackets, rules, strings, comments, etc) at the end of the
   stylesheet. For example:

      @media screen {
        p:before { content: 'Hello

   ...would be treated the same as:

      @media screen {
        p:before { content: 'Hello'; }
      }

   ...in a conformant UA.

Resolution:
Use the proposal above.
Change "(blocks, parentheses, brackets, rules, strings,
comments, etc)" to "(for example: blocks, parentheses, brackets,
rules, strings, and comments)"
Issue closed.

Issue 125.
Description:
How to handle unterminated constructs (line break in string).
Three sane options:
 * linefeed terminates the string,
 * strings can be multilined, or
 * unterminated strings terminate at a linefeed but make the
   declaration invalid.

Proposed text for the last bullet point:

   Unexpected end of string.

   User agents must close strings upon reaching the end of a line, but
   then drop the construct (declaration or rule) in which the string
   was found. For example:

      p {
        color: green;
        font-family: 'Courier New Times
        color: red;
        color: green;
      }

   ...would be treated the same as:

      p { color: green; color: green; }

   ...because the second declaration (from 'font-family' to the
   semicolon after 'color: red') is invalid and is dropped.

Resolution:
(done) Use the proposal text above.
Change the spec prose to allow control characters in
strings, if necessary (i.e. if it says anywhere that they are not
allowed).
(done) Allow control characters in strings in the grammar.
(done) Update grammar to make newline create an invalid string token.

Issue 126.
Description:
(from eddy@opera.com)

In the list of Absolute lengths, a little down from that heading:

   * pt: points - the points used by CSS 2.1 are equal to 1/72th of an inch.

This is *so* ugly: "1/72th of an inch"
If it's going to be said like that, it should be "1/72nd of an inch"
but it would be much more sensible to call it "inch / 72"
and far better to say
   * pt: points - 72 of the points used by CSS 2.1 are equal to one inch.
or
   * pt: points - the points used by CSS 2.1 are defined by 72pt = 1in.
but 72th is just broken grammar.

Furthermore, given that the pica is involved as well, it would make
sense to change the order of these two entries in the list and say:

  * pc: picas - 1 pica is equal to one sixth of an inch; 6pc = 1in.
  * pt: points - 1 point is equal to one twelfth of a pica; 12pt = 1pc.

and relegate the language about "used by CSS 2.1" to a sentence
outside this list, perhaps saying "although these units may have other
meanings in other contexts, the above definitions are normative for
CSS 2.1" or similar.  [That way it'll apply to the inch definition as
well; 2.54cm is a relatively modern specification.]

Hmm ... so pica is inch / 6 ?  I had it as inch / 12, and thus
redundant with the "line" - not necessarily, but possibly, a clue that
I got this wrong.  Do you know where CSS got this definition of the
pica ?  (I *don't* know where I got my version of pica.)

Resolution:
Reject except for 1/72th change.

Resolution:

In 17.5.3, replace:

"The baseline of a cell is the baseline of the first line box in the
cell. If there is no text, the baseline is the baseline of whatever
object is displayed in the cell, or, if it has none, the bottom of the
cell box."

...with:

"The baseline of a cell is the baseline of the first in-flow line box
in the cell, or the first in-flow table-row in the cell, whichever
comes first. If there is no such line box or table-row, the baseline
is the bottom of content edge of the cell box. For the purposes of
finding a baseline, in-flow boxes with a scrolling mechanisms (see the
'overflow' property) must be considered as if scrolled to their origin
position. Note that the baseline of a cell may end up below its bottom
border, see the example below."

...and take the rest of the paragraph ("The maximum distance between
the top of the cell box and the baseline over all cells that have
'vertical-align: baseline' is used to set the baseline of the row.
Here is an example:") and put it into a new paragraph.

Then add this example at the bottom of the section:

   The cell in this example has a baseline below its bottom border,
   which leaves an empty space below the cell in its table row:

      div { height: 0; overflow: hidden; }

      <table>
       <tr>
        <td>
         <div> Test </div>
        </td>
       </tr>
      </table>

...then change "Note that if there is no cell box aligned at its
baseline, the row will not have (nor need) a baseline." to be its own
paragraph and say:

"If a row has no cell box aligned to its baseline, the baseline of
that row is the bottom content edge of the lowest cell in the row."

| In "4.3.4 URL + URN = URI" of CSS21, there is such paragraph:
| 
|| Parentheses, commas, whitespace characters, single quotes (') and double
|| quotes (") appearing in an unquoted URI must be escaped with a
|| backslash: '\(', '\)', '\,'.
| 
| Shouldn't backslash itself be included in the must-be-escaped list?
| 
| Isn't it better example list to include all these characters (incl.
| whitespace, single quotes and double quotes)?
Resolution:

In 4.3.4:

 Some characters appearing in an unquoted URI, such as parentheses,
 commas, whitespace characters, single quotes (') and double quotes
 ("), must be escaped with a backslash: '\(', '\)', '\,'.

Fixing the use of terminology (first e-mail) is too much work and
won't be done for CSS2.1 unless we have a team of volunteers who are
willing to do the work and cross-check each other and take
responsibility for fixing any of the fall-out that will occur.

Remove "valid relative" from paragraph 1 of 6.1.2, and change "The
computed value of invalid and absolute URIs is the specified value."
to read:

   The computed value of URIs that the UA cannot resolve to absolute
   URIs is the specified value.

Description:
Rendering of 'table-caption' width is undefined.
Resolution:

Replace 17.4 with:

  In terms of the visual formatting model, a table can behave like a
  block-level (for 'display: table') or inline-level (for 'display:
  inline-table') element.

  In both cases, the table box generates an anonymous box that
  contains the table box itself and any caption boxes (in document
  order). The caption boxes are block-level boxes that retain their
  own content, padding, margin, and border areas, and are rendered as
  normal blocks inside the anonymous box. Whether the caption boxes
  are placed before or after the table box is decided by the
  'caption-side' property, as described below.

  The anonymous box is a 'block' box if the table is block-level, and
  an 'inline-block' box if the table is inline-level, except that this
  block is never considered as a block for 'run-in' interaction, and
  that the table box (not the anonymous box) is used when doing
  baseline vertical alignment for an 'inline-table'. The width of the
  anonymous box is the border-edge width of the table box inside it,
  as described by section 17.5.2. Percentages on 'width' on the table
  are relative to the anonymous box's containing block, not the
  anonymous box itself.

  The computed values of properties 'position', 'float', 'margin-*',
  'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left' on the table box are used on
  the anonymous box instead of the table box. The table box uses the
  initial values for those properties.

  [new image]

Replace the first two paragraphs after the <dl> in 17.4.1 with the
following note:

   Note: CSS2 described a different width and horizontal alignment
   behavior. That behavior will be introduced in CSS3 using the values
   'top-outside' and 'bottom-outside' on this property.

Description:

CSS2.1 spec explicitly refuses to define the case in which the height
is set but the number of rows is taller or smaller. It is noted that
this will be defined in future versions of CSS. We should define this
now.

If the table height is bigger than the height, ignore the height.

Resolution:

Replace, in 17.5.3 (note: the note remains after this edit):

   "CSS 2.1 does not specify rendering when the specified table height
   differs from the content height, in particular whether content
   height should override specified height; if it doesn't, how extra
   space should be distributed among rows that add up to less than the
   specified table height; or, if the content height exceeds the
   specified table height, whether the UA should provide a scrolling
   mechanism."

   "The 'height' property on 'table' boxes is treated as a minimum
   height. CSS 2.1 does not define how extra space is distributed when
   the 'height' property to be taller than it otherwise would be."

Resolution:

Add the following as a non-normative note at the top of chapter 17:

  This chapter defines the processing model for tables in CSS. Part of
  this processing model is the layout. For the layout, this chapter
  introduces two algorithms; the first, the fixed table layout
  algorithm, is well-defined, but the second, the automatic table
  layout algorithm, is not fully defined by this specification.

  For the automatic table layout algorithm, some widely deployed
  implementations have achieved relatively close interoperability.

Proposal1: Ignore (display:none) any additional columns and

Proposal2:

Change:

  It is undefined what happens if a subsequent row has more columns
  than the first. When using 'table-layout: fixed', authors should not
  omit columns from the first row.

...to:

  If a subsequent row has more columns than the first, then additional
  columns are rendered off the (original) edge of the table. New
  columns either have the widths specified for the cells in the first
  row that has that column, or, if that is 'auto', the width given by
  the (original) width of the table divided by the number of columns
  in the first row (i.e. the width that you would give a column in the
  first row if none of the cells had any widths specified).

  When using 'table-layout: fixed', authors should not omit columns
  from the first row.

Proposal3:

Change:

  It is undefined what happens if a subsequent row has more columns
