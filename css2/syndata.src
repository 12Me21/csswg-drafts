<H2>Basic Data types</H2>

<H3>Integers and numbers</H3>

<P>Some value types may have integer values, denoted by <span
	  class="index-def" title="&lt;integer&gt;, definition of"><a
	    name="value-def-integer"
	    class="value-def">&lt;integer&gt;</a></span> in this
	specification.

<P>Some value types may have real number values, denoted by <span
	  class="index-def" title="&lt;number&gt;, definition of"><a
	    name="value-def-number"
	    class="value-def">&lt;number&gt;</a></span> in this
	specification.

<H3><A NAME="length-units">Length units</A></H3>

<P> The format of a length value (denoted by <span class="index-def"
title="&lt;length&gt;, definition of"><a name="value-def-length"
class="value-def">&lt;length&gt;</a></span> in this specification) is
an optional sign character ('+' or '-', with '+' being the default)
immediately followed by a number (with or without a decimal point)
immediately followed by a unit identifier (a two-letter
abbreviation). After a '0' number, the unit identifier is optional.

<P> Some properties allow negative length units, but this may
complicate the formatting model and there may be
implementation-specific limits. If a negative length value cannot be
supported, it should be clipped to the nearest value that can be
supported.

<P> There are two types of length units: relative and absolute. <span
class="index-def" title="relative units">Relative units</span> specify
a length relative to another length property. Style sheets that use
relative units will more easily scale from one medium to another
(e.g., from a computer display to a laser printer). 

<P><A HREF="#percentage-units">Percentage units</A> (described below) and
keyword values (e.g. 'x-large') offer similar advantages.

<P> These relative units are supported:
  <PRE>
  H1 { margin: 0.5em }      /* ems, the height of the element's font */
  H1 { margin: 1ex }        /* x-height, ~ the height of the letter 'x' */
  P  { font-size: 12px }    /* pixels, relative to canvas */
</PRE>

<P> The relative units 'em' and 'ex' are relative to the font size of
the element itself. The only exception to this rule in CSS2 is the
'font-size' property where 'em' and 'ex' values refer to the font size
of the parent element.

<P> Pixel units, as used in the last rule, are relative to the
resolution of the canvas, i.e., most often a computer display. If the
pixel density of the output device is very different from that of a
typical computer display, the UA should rescale pixel values. The
suggested <span class="index-def"
title="reference-pixel"><EM>reference pixel</EM></span> is the visual
angle of one pixel on a device with a pixel density of 90dpi and a
distance from the reader of an arm's length. For a nominal arm's
length of 28 inches, the visual angle is about 0.0227 degrees.

<P> Child elements inherit the computed value, not the relative
	value. 

<div class="example"><P>
For example:
<PRE>
  BODY {
    font-size: 12pt;
    text-indent: 3em;  /* i.e. 36pt */
  }
  H1 { font-size: 15pt }
</PRE>

<P> In the example above, the 'text-indent' value of 'H1' elements
will be 36pt, not 45pt.
</div>

<P><span class="index-def" title="absolute length"><em> Absolute
length</em></span> units are only useful when the physical properties
of the output medium are known. These absolute units are supported:

<PRE>
  H1 { margin: 0.5in }      /* inches, 1in = 2.54cm */
  H2 { line-height: 3cm }   /* centimeters */
  H3 { word-spacing: 4mm }  /* millimeters */
  H4 { font-size: 12pt }    /* points, 1pt = 1/72 in */
  H4 { font-size: 1pc }     /* picas, 1pc = 12pt */
</PRE>

<P> In cases where the specified length cannot be supported, UAs
should try to approximate. For all CSS2 properties, further
computations and inheritance should be based on the approximated
value.

<H3> <A NAME="percentage-units">Percentage units</A></H3>

<P> The format of a percentage value (denoted by <span
class="index-def" title="&lt;percentage&gt;, definition of"><a
name="value-def-percentage"
class="value-def">&lt;percentage&gt;</a></span> in this specification)
is an optional sign character ('+' or '-', with '+' being the default)
immediately followed by a number (with or without a decimal point)
immediately followed by '%'.

<P> Percentage values are always relative to another value, for
example a length unit. Each property that allows percentage units also
defines what value the percentage value refer to. Most often this is
the font size of the element itself, as in:

<div class="example"><P>
<PRE>
  P { line-height: 120% }   /* 120% of the element's 'font-size' */
</PRE>
</div>

<P> In all inherited CSS2 properties, if the value is specified as a
percentage, child elements inherit the resultant value, not the
percentage value.

<H3><A NAME="url">URLs</A></H3>

<P> A Uniform Resource Locator, or <span class="index-def"
title="URL">URL</span> (denoted by <span class="index-def"
title="&lt;url&gt;, definition of"><a name="value-def-url"
class="value-def">&lt;url&gt;</a></span> in this specification) is
identified with a functional notation:

<PRE>
  BODY { background: url(http://www.bg.com/pinkish.gif) }
</PRE>

<P> The format of a URL value is 'url(' followed by optional white
space followed by an optional single quote (') or double quote (")
<!-- " --> character followed by the URL itself (as defined in <a
rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-RFC1738">[RFC1738]</a>)
followed by an optional single quote (') or double quote (") <!-- "
--> character followed by optional whitespace followed by ')'. Quote
characters that are not part of the URL itself must be balanced.

<P> Parentheses, commas, whitespace characters, single quotes (') and
double quotes (") <!-- " --> appearing in a URL must be escaped with a
backslash: '\(', '\)', '\,'.

<P> Partial URLs (as defined in <a rel="biblioentry"
href="./refs.html#ref-RFC1808">[RFC1808]</a>) are interpreted relative
to the source of the style sheet, not relative to the document:

<PRE>
  BODY { background: url(yellow) }
</PRE>

</BODY>
</html>
