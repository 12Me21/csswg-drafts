<h2>Translations of the CSS2 Specification</h2>

<p>The normative version of the specification is in English.  We plan
to provide translations in other languages, for people whose first
language is not English.  If you are in a position to help with this,
please write to H&aring;kon Lie <a href="mailto:howcome@w3.org">
howcome@w3.org</a>. We
expect you to give us permission to republish the translated version
and to allow readers to make copies without restrictions.
