<h2>Translations of the CSS2 Specification</h2>

<p>The normative version of the specification is in English. If
English is not your first language, we plan to provide translations in
other languages. If you are in a position to help with this, please
write to H&aring;kon Lie <a href="howcome@w3.org">howcome@w3.org</a>. We
expect you to give us permission to republish the translated version
and to allow readers to make copies without restrictions.
