<H2>Introduction to paged media</H2>

<P>Paged media -- paper, transparencies, pages that are displayed on
computer screens, etc. -- differ from <a
href="./media.html#continuous-media-group">continuous media</a> in
that formatting algorithms for pages must manage <a
href="./#page-breaks">page breaks.</a> To handle page breaks, CSS2
extends the <a href="visuren.html">visual rendering model</a>
as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <a href="#page-box">page
box</a> extends the <a href="visuren.html#box-model">box
model</a> to allow authors to specify the size of a page, its margins,
etc.  

<li>The <span class="index-def" title="page model"><dfn>page
model</dfn></span> extends the <a
href="visuren.html#layout">layout</a> algorithms to account for <a
href="#page-breaks">page breaks.</a> 
</ol>

<P>The CSS2 <a name="page-model">page model</a> specifies how a
document is formatted within a rectangular area -- the <a
href="#page-box">page box</a> -- that has a finite width and
height. The page box does not necessarily correspond to the real <span
class="index-def" title="sheet"><dfn>sheet</dfn></span> where the
document will ultimately be rendered (paper, transparency, screen,
etc.).  The CSS page model specifies formatting in the page box, but
it is the user agent's responsibility to transfer the page box to the
sheet. Some transfer possibilities include:</P>

<ul>
<li>Transferring one page box to one sheet (e.g., single-sided printing).
<li>Transferring two page boxes to both sides of the same sheet (e.g.,
double-sided printing).
<li>Transferring N (small) page boxes to one sheet (called "n-up").
<li>Transferring one (large) page box to N x M sheets (called "tiling").
<li>Creating signatures. A signature is a group of pages
printed on a sheet, which, when folded and trimmed like a book, appear in their
proper sequence.
<li>Printing one document to several output trays.
<li>Outputting to a file.
</ul>

<P>Although CSS2 does not specify how user agents transfer page boxes
to sheets, it does include certain mechanisms for telling user agents
about the target sheet <a href="#page-size-prop">size and
orientation</a>.

<H2><a name="page-box">Page boxes</a>: the @page rule</H2>

<P>The <span class="index-def" title="page box"><dfn>page
box</dfn></span> is a rectangular region that contains two
embedded areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <span class="index-def" title="page area"><a
name="page-area"><dfn>page area</dfn></a></span>. The page
area includes the boxes laid out on that page.
The edges of the page area act as a <a
href="visudet.html#containing-block">containing block</a> for layout
that occurs between page breaks. It also acts as the <a
href="visudet.html#initial-containing-block">initial containing
block</a>. 
<li>The margin area (see the <a href="visuren.html#box-margin-area">
margin area</a> of the box model).
</ul>

<div class="note"><P> 
<em><strong>Note.</strong> In CSS2, the <a
href="./visudet.html#border-properties">border properties</a> and <a
href="./visudet.html#padding-properties">padding properties</a> 
do not apply to pages; they may in the future.
</em>
</div>

<P>Authors specify the dimensions, orientation, margins,
etc. of a page box within an <span class="index-def"
title="@page">@page</span> rule.</p>

<div class="example"><P>
For example, the following @page rule sets the margins of the page to 2cm.

<pre>
   @page { margin: 2cm }
</pre>
</div>

<p>Declarations inside the curly braces of the @page rule apply to
every page of a document; these declarations are said to be in the
<span class="index-def" title="page-context"><a name="page-context"><dfn>page
context</dfn></a></span>.  Authors specify the dimensions of the page box
with the <span class="propinst-size">'size'</span> property.  The
<span class="propinst-marks">'marks'</span> property is used to
specify crop and cross marks.

<h3><a name="page-margins">Page margins</a></h3>

<P>The <a href="visudet.html#margin-properties">margin properties</a>
(<span class="propinst-margin-top">'margin-top'</span>, <span
class="propinst-margin-right">'margin-right'</span>, <span
class="propinst-margin-bottom">'margin-bottom'</span>, <span
class="propinst-margin-left">'margin-left'</span>, and <span
class="propinst-margin">'margin'</span>) apply within the <a
href="#page-context">page context</a>. The following diagram shows the
relationships between the sheet, page box, and page margins:</P>

<P><img src="./images/page-info.gif" alt="Illustration of sheet, page box, and margin."></p>

<P>The CSS2 rules for <a
href="visudet.html#collapsing-margins">collapsing vertical margins</a>
apply to page margins as well. For example, the margin of the first
box on a page will collapse with the page margin.

<p>The <a href="#page-context">page context</a> has no notion of
fonts, so 'em' and 'ex' units are not allowed. Percentage values on
the margin properties are relative to the dimensions of the <a
href="#page-box">page box</a>.  All other units associated with the
respective CSS2 properties are allowed.

<P>Due to negative margin values (either on the page box or on
elements) or <a href="visuren.html#absolute-positioning">absolute
positioning</a> content may end up outside the page box, but this
content may be "cut" -- by the user agent, the printer, or ultimately,
the paper cutter.

<h3><a name="page-size-prop">Page size</a>: the <span
class="propinst-size">'size'</span> property</h3>

<!-- #include src=properties/size.srb -->

<P>This property specifies the size and orientation of a page box.

<P>The size of a page box may either be "absolute" (fixed size) or
"relative" (scalable, i.e., fitting available sheet sizes). Relative
page boxes allow user agents to scale a document and make optimal use
of the target size. Absolute page boxes ensure precise formatting when
that is the author's prerogative.

<P>Three values for the <span class="propinst-size">'size'</span>
property create a relative page box:

<DL>
<DT><strong>auto</strong>
<DD>The page box will be set to the size and orientation of the
target sheet. 

<DT><strong>landscape</strong>
<DD>Overrides the target's orientation.  The page box is the same
size as the target, and the normal direction of layout runs
parallel to the longer target side.

<DT><strong>portrait</strong>
<DD>Overrides the target's orientation. The page box is the same
size as the target, and the normal direction of layout runs
parallel to the shorter target side.
</DL>

<div class="example"><P>
<p>In the following example, the outer edges of the page box will align
with the target. The percentage value on the <span
class="propinst-margin">'margin'</span> property is relative to the
target size so if the target sheet dimensions are
21.0cm x 29.7cm (i.e., A4), the margins are 2.10cm and 2.97cm.

<pre>
  @page {
    size: auto;   /* auto is the initial value */
    margin: 10%;
  }
</pre>
</div>

<P>Length values for the <span class="propinst-size">'size'</span>
property create an absolute page box. If only one length value is
specified, it sets both the width and height of the page box (i.e.,
the box is a square). Since the page box is the <a
href="visudet.html#initial-containing-block">initial containing
block</a>, percentage values are not allowed for the <span
class="propinst-size">'size'</span> property.

<div class="example"><P>
For example:

<PRE>
  @page {
    size: 8.5in 11in;  /* width height */
  }
</PRE>

<P>The above example set the width of the page box to be 8.5in and the
height to be 11in. The page box in this example requires a target
sheet size of 8.5&quot;x11&quot; or larger.
</div>

<P>User agents may allow users to control the transfer of the page
box to the sheet (e.g., rotating an absolute page box that's
being printed).

<h4>Rendering page boxes that do not fit a target sheet</h4>

<P>If page box does not fit the target sheet dimensions, the 
user agent may choose to:</p>

<UL>
<LI>Rotate the page box 90° if this will make the page box fit.
<LI>Scale the page to fit the target.
</UL>

<P>The user agent should consult the user before performing these
operations.

<h4>Positioning the page box on the sheet</h4>

<P>When the page box is smaller than the target size, the user agent
is free to place the page box anywhere on the sheet. However, it is
recommended that the page box be centered on the sheet since this will
align double-sided pages and avoid accidental loss of information that
is printed near the edge of the sheet.

<h3><a name="crop-mark-prop">Crop marks</a>: the <span
class="propinst-marks">'marks'</span> property</h3>

<!-- #include src=properties/marks.srb -->

<p>In high-quality printing, marks are often added outside the
page box. This property describes specifies whether cross
marks or crop marks or both should be rendered just outside the <a
href="#page-box">page box</a> edge. Values have the following
meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>cross</strong>
<dd><span class="index-def" title="crop marks"><dfn>Crop
marks</dfn></span> indicate where the page should be cut.
<dt><strong>crop</strong>
<dd><span
class="index-def" title="cross marks"><dfn>cross marks</dfn></span>
(also known as register marks or registration marks) are used to align
sheets.
<dt><strong>none</strong>
<dd>Don't render any special marks.
</dl>

<P>Marks are only visible on absolute page boxes. In relative page
boxes, the page box will be aligned with the target and the marks
will be outside the printable area.

<P>The size, style, and position of cross marks depends on the user
agent.

<h3>Left, right, and first pages</H3>

<P>When printing double-sided documents, the <a href="#page-box">page
boxes</a> on left and right pages should be different. This can be
expressed through two CSS pseudo-classes that may be defined in the
<a href="#page-context">page context</a>.

<P>All pages are automatically classified by user agents into either
the <span class="index-def"
title=":left|pseudo-class:::left">:left</span> or <span
class="index-def" title=":right|pseudo-class:::right">:right</span>
pseudo-class.

<div class="example"><P>
<PRE>
  @page :left {
    margin-left: 4cm;
    margin-right: 3cm;
  }

  @page :right {
    margin-left: 3cm;
    margin-right: 4cm;
  }
</PRE>
</div>

<P>If different declarations have been given for left and right pages,
the user agent must honor these declarations even if the user agent
does not transfer the page boxes to left and right sheets (e.g., a
printer that only prints single-sided). 

<P>Authors may also specify style for the first page of a document
with the <span class="index-def"
title=":first|pseudo-class:::first">:first</span> pseudo-class:

<div class="example"><P>
<PRE>
  @page { margin: 2cm } /* All margins set to 2cm */

  @page :first {
    margin-top: 10cm    /* Top margin on first page 10cm */
  }
</PRE>
</div>

<P>Whether the first page of a document is :left or :right depends on
the major writing direction of the document and is outside the scope
of this document. However, to force a :left or :right first page,
authors may insert a page break before the first generated box (e.g.,
in HTML, specify this for the BODY element).

<P>Properties specified in a :left (or :right) @page rule override
those specified in an @page rule that has no pseudo-class specified.
Properties specified in a :first @page rule override those specified
in :left (or :right) @page rules.

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
Adding declarations to the :left or :right pseudo-class does not
influence whether the document comes out of the printer double- or
single-sided (which is outside the scope of this specification). 
</em>
</div>

<div class="note"><P>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
Future versions of CSS may include other page pseudo-classes.
</em>
</div>

<h3>Content outside the page box</h3>

<P>When formatting content in the page model, some content may end up
outside the page box. For example, an element whose <span
class="propinst-white-space">'white-space'</span> property has the
value 'pre' may generate a box that is wider than the page box. Also,
when boxes are positioned <a
href="visuren.html#absolute-positioning">absolutely</a> or <a
href="visuren.html#floats">floated</a>, they may end up in
"inconvenient" locations. For example, images may be placed on the
edge of the page box or 100,000 inches below the page box.

<P>A specification for the exact formatting of such elements lies
outside the scope of this document. However, we recommend that authors
and user agents observe the following general principles concerning
content outside the page box:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content should be allowed slightly beyond the page box to allow
   pages to "bleed".

<li>User agents should avoid generating a large number of empty page
boxes to honor the positioning of elements (e.g., you don't want to
print 100 blank pages). Note, however, that generating a small number
of empty page boxes may be necessary to honor the 'left' and 'right'
values for <span
class="propinst-page-break-before">'page-break-before'</span> and
<span class="propinst-page-break-after">'page-break-after'</span>.

<li>Authors should not position elements in inconvenient locations as
a means to avoid laying them out. Instead:

<ul>
<li>To suppress box generation entirely, set the <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> property to 'none'.
<li>To render a box invisible, use the <span
class="propinst-visibility">'visibility'</span> property.
</ul>

<LI>User agents may handle boxes positioned outside the page box in
several ways, including discarding them or creating page boxes for
them at the end of the document.
</ul>

<H2><a name="page-breaks">Page breaks</a></H2>

<P>The following sections explain page formatting in CSS2. Four
properties indicate where the user agent may or should break pages,
and on what page (left or right) the subsequent content should resume.
Each page break ends layout in the current <a href="#page-box">page
box</a> and causes remaining pieces of the <a
href="conform.html#doctree">document tree</a> to be laid out in a new
page box.

<h3><a name="page-break-props">Page break properties</a>: <span
class="propinst-page-break-before">'page-break-before'</span>,
<span class="propinst-page-break-after">'page-break-after'</span>, 
<span class="propinst-orphans">'orphans'</span>, and
<span class="propinst-widows">'widows'</span>
</h3>

<!-- #include src=properties/page-break-before.srb -->

<!-- #include src=properties/page-break-after.srb -->

<P>Values for these properties have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>auto</strong></dt>
<dd>Neither force nor forbid a page break before (resp., after) the 
generated box.
<dt><strong>always</strong></dt>
<dd>Always force a page break before (resp., after) the 
generated box.</dd>
<dt><strong>avoid</strong></dt>
<dd>Avoid a page break before (resp., after) the generated box.
<dt><strong>left</strong></dt>
<dd>(For rendering to left and right sheets.) 
Force one or two page breaks before
(resp., after) the generated box 
so that the next page is formated as a left page.</dd>
<dt><strong>right</strong></dt>
<dd>(For rendering to left and right sheets.) 
Force one or two page breaks before (resp., after) the generated
box so that the next page is formatted as a right page.</dd>
</dl>

<P>When both properties have values other than 'auto', the values
'always', 'left', and 'right' take precedence over 'avoid'.  See the
section on <a href="#allowed-page-breaks">allowed page breaks</a> for
the exact rules on how these values force or suppress a page break.

<!-- #include src=properties/orphans.srb -->

<!-- #include src=properties/widows.srb -->

<P>These properties specify the minimum number of lines of a paragraph
that must be left at the bottom (<span
class="propinst-orphans">'orphans'</span>) and top (<span
class="propinst-widows">'widows'</span>) of a page (see the section on
<a href="visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a> for information about
paragraph formatting).

<h3><a name="allowed-page-breaks">Allowed page breaks</a></h3>

<p>In the normal flow, page breaks can occur at the following places:</p>

<ol>
<li>
In the vertical margin between block-level boxes. When a page
break occurs here, the <a href="cascade.html#computed-value">computed
values</a> 
of the relevant
<span class="propinst-margin-top">'margin-top'</span>
and <span class="propinst-margin-bottom">'margin-bottom'</span>
properties are set to '0'.
<li>Between <a href="visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a>
inside a <a href="visuren.html#block-level">block-level</a> box.
</ol>

<p>These breaks are subject to the following rules:

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>Breaking at (1) is only allowed if the <span
class="propinst-page-break-after">'page-break-after'</span> and <span
class="propinst-page-break-before">'page-break-before'</span> properties of all
the elements generating boxes that
meet at this margin allow it, which is when at least
one of them has the value 'always', 'left', or 'right', or when all of them are
'auto'.
<li>
Breaking at (2) is only allowed if the number of <a
href="visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a> between the
break and the start of the block is <span
class="propinst-orphans">'orphans'</span> or more, and the number of
line boxes between the break and the end of the block is <span
class="propinst-widows">'widows'</span> or more.
</ol>

<p>There is an exception to both rules:

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>
Breaking at (1) and (2) is also allowed if, between the last page break
and the next one that would be allowed under (A) and (B), there is so
much content that it can't fit within a single <a
href="#page-box">page box</a>.
</ol>

<P>Page breaks cannot occur inside boxes that are <a
href="visuren.html#absolute-positioning">absolutely-positioned</a>.

<!-- What about relative positioning? -IJ -->

<h3>Forced page breaks</h3>

<p>A page break <em>must</em> occur at (1) if, among the <span
class="propinst-page-break-after">'page-break-after'</span> and <span
class="propinst-page-break-before">'page-break-before'</span>
properties of all the elements generating boxes that meet at this
margin, there is at least one with the value 'always', 'left', or
'right'.

<h3>"Best" page breaks</h3>

<p>CSS does <em>not</em> define which of the page breaks allowed by
(A), (B), or (C) should be used. In particular, CSS does not forbid a
user agent from breaking at every possible break point, or not to
break at all. But CSS does recommend that user agents observe the
following heuristics (while recognizing that they are sometimes
contradictory):</p>

<ul>
<li>Break as few times as possible.
<li>Make all pages that don't end with a forced break appear to have about
the same height.
<li>Avoid breaking inside a block that has a border.
<li>Avoid breaking inside a table.
<li>Avoid breaking inside a floating element
</ul>

<div class="example"><P> 
Suppose, for example, that <span
class="propinst-orphans">'orphans'</span>=4, <span
class="propinst-widows">'widows'</span>=2, and 
there are 20 lines (<a href="visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a>
available at the bottom of the current page:</p>

<ul>

<li>If a paragraph at the end of the current page contains 20 lines or fewer,
it should be placed on the current page.

<li>If the paragraph contains 21 - 22 lines, the second part of the
paragraph must not violate the <span
class="propinst-widows">'widows'</span> constraint, and so the
second part must contain exactly two lines

<li>If the paragraph contains 23 lines or more, the first part should
contain 20 lines and the second part the remaining lines.
						    
</ul>

<P>Now suppose that <span class="propinst-orphans">'orphans'</span>=10,
<span class="propinst-widows">'widows'</span>=20, 
and there are 8 lines available at the bottom of the current page:</p>

<ul>

<li>If a paragraph at the end of the current page contains 8 lines or
fewer, it should be placed on the current page.

<li>If the paragraph contains 9 lines or more, it cannot be split
(that would violate the orphan constraint), so it should move 
as a block to the next page.
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Cascading in the page context</H2>

<P>Declarations in the <a href="#page-context">page context</a> obey
the <a href="cascade.html">cascade</a> just like normal CSS2
declarations.

<div class="example"><P>
Consider the following example:

<PRE>
  @page {
    margin-left: 3cm;
  }

  @page :left {
    margin-left: 4cm;
  }
</PRE>

<P>Due to the <a href="cascade.html#cascading-order">higher
specificity</a> of the pseudo-class selector, the left margin on left
pages will be '4cm' and all other pages (i.e., the right pages) will
have a left margin of '3cm'.
