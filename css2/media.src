<!-- Hakon: introduce notion of "viewport"? -->
<P> The <span class="index-def" title="canvas"><em>canvas</em></span>
is the part of the UA's drawing surface onto which
documents are rendered. No structural element of a document
corresponds to the canvas, and this raises two issues when formatting
a document:

<UL>
<LI> from where should the dimensions of the canvas be set?
<LI> when the document doesn't cover the whole canvas, how should this
     area be rendered?
</UL>

<P> A reasonable answer to the first question is that the initial size
of the canvas is based on the window size, but CSS2 leaves this issue
for the UA to decide. It is also reasonable to expect the UA to change
the canvas size when the window is resized, but this is also outside
the scope of CSS2.

<H3>The HTML canvas</H3>
<P> HTML extensions have set a precedent for the second question:
attributes on the BODY element set the background of the whole
canvas. To support designers' expectations, CSS2 introduces a special
rule to find the canvas background:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    If the <span id="propinst-background" class="propinst">'background'</span> value of the
    HTML element is different from 'transparent' then use it, else use
    the <span id="propinst-background" class="propinst">'background'</span> value of the BODY
    element. If the resulting value is 'transparent', the rendering is
    undefined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This rule allows:

<PRE>
  &lt;HTML style="background: url(http://style.com/marble.png)"&gt;
  &lt;BODY style="background: red"&gt;
</PRE>

<P> In the example above, the canvas will be covered with
"marble". The background of the BODY element (which may or may not
fully cover the canvas) will be red.

<P> Until other means of addressing the canvas become available, it is
recommended that canvas properties are set on the BODY element.
