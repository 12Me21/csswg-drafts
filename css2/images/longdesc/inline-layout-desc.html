      <h1>Long description for line breaking</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the effect of line breaking on the display
of margins, borders, and padding.

<P>
It shows the rendering of the HTML example preceeding the image in the
main document: a paragraph reading "Several emphasized words appear
here."  where the line breaks between the words "emphasized" and
"words", thus generating two splitted boxes, both with a dash line
border style (3 side only). See the main document for more explanation.
