      <h1>Long description for flow clear</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the effects of floating a box with setting
the clear property to control the flow of text around the element.

<P>

A document window is shown, with 8 lines numbered 1 to 8. Line height
is 24px. Five lines of text are displayed, occupying line 1 thru 5:
<PRE>
 Beginning of body contents. Start 
 of outer contents.     | Inner
                        | contents.
 Sibling contents. End  of outer 
 contents. End of body contents.
</PRE>
<P>The word "Inner contents" appear in a box of their own (hence the |
in the PRE above), floating right the page, with a width 130px.
"Siblind content" appears below this box, not next to it as in the
previous figure (clear effect).

<P>The default color of text is black.
"Start of outer contents" is red.
"Sibling contents" is red.
"Inner contents" is blue.
"End of outer contents" is red.
