      <h1>Long description for floating boxes and overlap</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates a floating image that overlaps the borders
of two paragraphs: the borders are interrupted by the image.

<P>
There are two paragraphs, one on top each other, both surrounded
by a red border. 
An image appears floating on the left bottom part of the top
paragraph, extending to the top left portion of the bottom
paragraph. The paragraph borders shine through the margin area
of the image box. The image content area obscures them 
(i.e., the red border touches the image).
