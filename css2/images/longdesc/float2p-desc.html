      <h1>Long description for floating boxes and overlap</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates a floating image that overlaps the borders
of two paragraphs: the borders are interrupted by the image.

<P>
There are two paragraphs, one on top each other, both with a red line
border. An image appears floating on the left bottom part of the top
paragraph, extending to the top left portion of the bottom
paragraph. The image has a margin space which lets thru the paragraph
borders,  while the image itself obscures them (i.e. the red border
touches the image).
