      <h1>Long description for example showing how structurally
      overlapping cells are rendered</h1>

<P>This diagram shows how the CSS table model causes structurally
overlapping cells to be rendered visually without overlap.
<strong>Note.</strong> The HTML table in this example is illegal since
HTML 4.0 states that tables cannot have overlapping cells.

<P>The diagram depicts two renderings of the table specified in the
HTML example preceding the image. While some user agents may produce
the left rendering, CSS user agents may only produce the right
rendering. In both tables, cells have gray backgrounds and a black
border. Each contains a single integer label. Cells are separated from
each other by cell spacing.

<P>The left table has a top row of four cells. The second cell spans
rows one and two. The second row of the table contains one cell that
spans columns one and two. Thus, two cells overlap at the cell in the
second row, second column. The overlap is depicted by a darker gray
background.

<P>The right table has a top row of four cells. The second cell spans
rows one and two. The second row of the table contains one cell that
spans columns three and four. Thus, no cells overlap visually.
