      <h1>Long description for floating boxes and clear</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates a floating image and the effect of 'clear: left' on the two paragraphs.

<P>
There are two paragraphs, one on top each other, both with a red line
border. An image appears floating on the left bottom part of the top
paragraph, extending to the top border of the bottom paragraph, which
appears pushed down to leave room for the image (no overlap
there). The image itself has a margin space on all side which lets
thru the top paragraph border, while the bottom paragraph border is
right outside the bottom image margin.
