      <h1>Long description for floating boxes and margins</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates how floating boxes interact with margins.

<P>
It shows the rendering of some image and floating text, surronded by
margins. First, there is a top caption indicating that the margin
value is "max (BODY margin, P margin)", then below and from left to
right: an indication of the presense of a BODY margin, a P margin, the
page content itself as an image included in its own box surrounded by
its own IMG margins, with text floating to the right and below the
image box, then a P margin again and a BODY margin to the far right.
