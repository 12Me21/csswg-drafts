      <h1>Long description for change bar</h1>

<P>This diagram illustrates the use of floats to create a changebar
effect.

<P>

A document window is shown, with 4 lines of text:
<PRE>
  I used two red hyphens to serve 
  as a change bar. They will "float"
  to the left of the line containing 
--THIS word.
</PRE>

<P>The default color of text is black.
"--" appears in red, offset to the left of the normal text flow.
