<TITLE>Appendix B: Changes from CSS1</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1 align="center">Changes from CSS1</H1>
<P><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></P>

<P>CSS2 builds on CSS1 and all valid CSS1 style sheets are valid CSS2
style sheets. The changes between the CSS1 specification (see
[[CSS1]]) and this specification fall into three groups: new
functionality, updated descriptions of CSS1 functionality, and changes
to CSS1.

<H2>New functionality</H2>

<P>In addition to the functionality of CSS1, CSS2 supports:</p>

<UL>

<LI>The concept of <A HREF="media.html">media types</A>.

<LI>The <a href="cascade.html#value-def-inherit">'inherit'</a> 
value for all properties.

<LI><A HREF="page.html">Paged media</A>

<LI><A HREF="aural.html">Aural style sheets</A>

<LI>Several internationalization features, including <a
href="generate.html#lists">list numbering styles</a>, support for <a
href="visuren.html#direction">bidirectional text</a>, and support for
language-sensitive <a href="generate.html#quotes">quotation
marks</a>.

<LI><A HREF="fonts.html#font-selection">An extended font selection</A>
mechanism, including intelligent matching, synthesis, and downloadable
fonts. Also, the concept of system fonts has been is introduced, and a
new property, <span
class="propinst-font-size-adjust">'font-size-adjust'</span>, has been added.

<LI><A HREF="tables.html">Tables</A>, including new values on <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> and <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span>.

<LI><A HREF="visuren.html#relative-positioning">Relative</A> and <A
HREF="visuren.html#absolute-positioning">absolute positioning</A>,
including <A HREF="visuren.html#fixed-positioning">fixed
positioning</A>.

<LI>New box types (along with block and inline): <a
href="visuren.html#compact">compact</a> and <a href="visuren.html#run-in">
run-in</a>.

<LI>The ability to control content <a
href="visufx.html#overflow">overflow</a>, <a
href="visufx.html#clipping">clipping</a>, and <a
href="visufx.html#visibility">visibility</a> in the visual formatting
model.

<LI>The ability to specify minimum and maximum <a
href="visudet.html#min-max-widths">widths</a> and <a
href="visudet.html#min-max-heights">heights</a> in the visual
formatting model.

<LI>An extended <A HREF="selector.html">selector</A> mechanism,
including child selectors, adjacent selectors, and attribute selectors.

<LI><A HREF="generate.html#generated-text">Generated content</a>,
<a href="generate.html#counters">counters and automatic numbering</A>, and
<a href="generate.html#markers">markers</a>.

<LI>Text shadows, through the new <span
class="propinst-text-shadow">'text-shadow'</span> property.

<LI>Several new <A
HREF="selector.html#pseudo-classes">pseudo-classes</A>, :first-child, :hover,
:focus, :lang.

<LI>System <A HREF="ui.html#system-colors">colors</A> and 
<A href="ui.html#system-fonts">fonts</a>.

<LI><A href="ui.html#cursor-props">Cursors</a>.

<LI><A href="ui.html#dynamic-outlines">Dynamic outlines</a>.

</UL>



<H2>Updated descriptions</H2>

<P>The CSS1 specification was short and concise. This specification is
much more voluminous and more readable. Much of the additional content
describes new functionality, but the description of CSS1 features has
also been extended. Except in a few cases described below, the
rewritten descriptions do not indicate a change in syntax nor
semantics. 

<H2><a name="changes-from-css1">Semantic changes from CSS1</a></H2>

<P>While all CSS1 style sheets are valid CSS2 style sheets, there are
a few cases where the CSS1 style sheet will have a different meaning
when interpreted as a CSS2 style sheet. Most changes are due to
implementation experience feeding back into the specification, but
there are also some error corrections.

<UL>
<LI>The meaning of "!important" has been changed. In CSS1,
"!important" in an author's style sheet took precedence over
one in a user style sheet. This has been reversed in CSS2.


<LI>In CSS2 <A HREF="syndata.html#color-units">color values</A> are clipped
with regard to the device gamut, not with regard to the sRGB gamut as
in CSS1.

<LI>CSS1 simply said that 'margin-right' was ignored if the both
'margin-left' and 'width' were set. In CSS2 the choice between
relaxing 'margin-right' or 'margin-left' depends on the writing direction.

<LI>In CSS1, several properties (e.g., 'padding') had values referring
to the width of the parent element. This was an error; the value
should always refer to the width of a block-level element and this
specification reflects this by introducing the term "containing block".

<LI>The initial value of 'display' is 'inline' in CSS2, not 'block' as
in CSS1.

<LI>In CSS1, the 'clear' property applied to all elements. This was an
error, and the property only applies to block-level elements in CSS2.

<LI>In CSS1, <span class="index-inst"
title="pseudo-classes:::link|:link|link
(pseudo-class)">':link'</span>, <span class="index-inst"
title="pseudo-classes:::visited|:visited|visited
(pseudo-class)">':visited'</span> and <span class="index-inst"
title="pseudo-classes:::active|:active|active
(pseudo-class)">':active'</span> were mutually exclusive; in CSS2, <a
href="selector.html#dynamic-pseudo-classes">':active'</a> can occur
together with <a href="selector.html#link-pseudo-classes">':link' or
':visited'</a>.

<LI>The suggested scaling factor between adjacent <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span> indexes in the table of font
sizes has been reduced from 1.5 to 1.2.

<LI>The computed value, not the actual value, of <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span> is inherited.

<li>Please also consult the <em>normative</em> section on the <a
href="grammar.html#tokenizer-diffs">differences between the CSS1 and
CSS2 tokenizer</a>.
