<P><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></P>

<P>CSS&nbsp;2.1 is an updated revision of CSS2. The changes between the
CSS2 specification (see [[CSS2]]) and this specification fall into
five groups: known errors, typographical errors, clarifications,
changes and additions. Typographical errors are not listed here.</P>

<p>This chapter is not a complete list of changes. Minor editorial
changes and most changes to examples are also not listed here.</p>


<h2><a name="new">Additional property values</a></h2>

<h3 id="s-4-3-5"><a href="syndata.html#color-units">Section 4.3.5
Colors</a></h3>

<p>New color value: 'orange'

<h3 id="s-9-2-4"><a href="visuren.html#propdef-display">Section 9.2.4

<h3 id="s-12-2a"><a href="generate.html#content">Section 12.2 The
'content' property</a></h3>

<p>New 'content' values 'none' and 'normal'. (The values 'none' and
'normal' are equivalent in CSS&nbsp;2.1, but may have different
functions in CSS3.)

<h3 id="s-18-1"><a href="ui.html#propdef-cursor">Section 18.1 Cursors:
the 'cursor' property</a></h3>

<p>New 'white-space' values: 'pre-wrap' and 'pre-line'


<h2><a name="changes">Changes</a></h2>

<h3 id="c1.1"><a href="about.html#q1">Section 1.1 CSS 2.1 vs CSS 2</a></h3>

<p>This new section is added to explain the motivation for CSS2.1
and its relation to CSS2.</p>

<h3 id="c1.2"><a href="about.html#q2">Section 1.2 Reading the specification</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly Section 1.1) has been marked non-normative.</p>

<h3 id="c1.3"><a href="about.html#q3">Section 1.3 How the specification is organized</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly Section 1.2) has been marked non-normative.</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.2.1"><a href="about.html#q7">Section 1.4.2.1 Value</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly unnumbered under 1.3.2) notes that value types are specified
in terms of tokens and that spaces may appear between tokens in values. A note
explains that spaces are required between some tokens.</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.2.6"><a href="about.html#q12">Section 1.4.2.6 Media groups</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly unnumbered under 1.3.2) now declares the Media line
in property definitions to be non-normative.</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.2.7"><a href="about.html#q13">Section 1.4.2.7 Computed value</a></h3>

<p>A new line is added to each property definition specifying what the computed
values are for the property. (This defines what level of computation is done to
a property value before inheritance and before certain other calculations.)</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.4"><a href="about.html#q15">Section 1.4.4 Notes and examples</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly 1.3.4) now specifies that HTML examples lacking DOCTYPE
declarations are SGML Text Entities conforming to the HTML 4.01 Strict DTD [HTML4].
The markup for many examples has been reformulated to either include a DOCTYPE or
conform to this definition.</p>

<h3 id="c1.5"><a href="about.html#q17">Section 1.5 Acknowledgements</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly 1.4) has been updated to reflect contributions to CSS2.1
and has been marked non-normative.<p>

<h3 id="c3.2"><a href="conform.html#conformance">Section 3.2
Conformance</a></h3>

<p>Support for user style sheets is now required (in most cases),
rather than just recommended.

<p>Support for turning of author style sheets is now required.</p>

<p>Application of CSS properties to form controls is explicitly undefined.
Authors are recommended to treat form control styling capabilities in UAs
as experimental.</p>

<h3 id="c3.2"><a href="conform.html#q3">Section 3.3
Error Conditions</a></h3>

<p>This section changed to say that error handling <em>is</em> specified
in most cases.</p>

<h3 id="c6.1"><a href="cascade.html#q1">Section 6.1 Specified, computed, and actual values</a></h3>

<p>Redefined "computed value" and created the concept of "used value"
so that inheritance can be performed without laying out the document.
This change has the effect of allowing (requiring) percentages to be inherited
as percentages and affects many other layout calculations throughout the spec.</p>

<p>Since computed value of a property can now also be a percentage. In
particular, the following properties now inherit the percentage if the
specified value is a percentage:

<ul>
<li>background-position
<li>bottom, left, right, top
<li>height, width
<li>margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right, margin-top,
<li>min-height, min-width
<li>padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right, padding-top
<li>text-indent
</ul>

<p>Note that only 'text-indent' inherits by default, the others only
inherit if the 'inherit' keyword is specified.

<h3 id="c6.4.1"><a href="cascade.html#cascading-order">Section 6.4.1 Cascading order</a></h3>

<p>Changed suggestion that user be able to turn off author styles to a requirement.</p>

<h3 id="c6.4.3"><a href="cascade.html#specificity">Section 6.4.3
Calculating a selector's specificity</a></h3>

<p>The "style" attribute now has a higher specificity than any style
rule.</p>

<p>Pseudo-elements are now counted with elements in calculating a
a selector's specificity.</p>

<h3 id="c6.4.4"><a href="cascade.html#q13">Section 6.4.4 Precedence
of non-CSS presentational hints</a></h3>

<p>"Non-CSS presentational hints" no longer exist, with the exception
of a small set of attributes in HTML.</p>

<h3 id="c8.3">a href="box.html#margin-properties">Section 8.3 Margin properties</a></h3>

<p>If the containing block's width depends on an element with percentage
margins, then the resulting layout is undefined in CSS 2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c8.3.1"><a href="box.html#collapsing-margins">Section 8.3.1 Collapsing margins</a></h3>

<p>In the definition of "collapsing margins", added "non-empty content"
and "clearance" to the parenthetical list of things that prevent consecutive
margins from being adjoining.</p>

<p>Vertical margins of elements with 'overflow' other than 'visible' no longer
collapse with their in-flow children.</p>

<p>Defined how margins collapse through an element with adjoining top and
bottom margins.</p>

<p>Added that margins of the root element's box do not collapse.</p>

<p>More rigorously <a href="box.html#what-is-adjoining">defined "adjoining" for margin collapsing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c8.4"><a href="box.html#padding-properties">Section 8.4 Padding properties</a></h3>

<p>If the containing block's width depends on an element with percentage
padding, then the resulting layout is undefined in CSS 2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c8.5.2"><a href="box.html#border-color-properties">Section 8.5.2 Border color</a></h3>

<p>'transparent' can now be specified independently for each border side,
on par with &lt;color>.</p>

<h3 id="c8.5.3"><a href="box.html#border-style-properties">Section 8.5.3 Border style</a></h3>

<p>3D border styles ('groove', 'ridge', 'inset', 'outset') now depend on the
corresponding border-color rather than on 'color'.</p>

<h3 id="c8.6"><a href="box.html#q11">Section 8.6 The box model for inline elements in bidirection context</a></h3>

<p>Added this new section to specify layout of inline boxes when affected by bidi.</p>

<h3 id="visuren"><a href="visuren.html">Chapter 9 Visual formatting
model</a></h3>

<p>The value 'compact' for 'display' does not exist in CSS&nbsp;2.1.

<h3 id="s-10-3-7"><a
href="visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width">Section 10.3.7 Absolutely
positioned, non-replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>Absolutely positioned elements can now "shrink-wrap" their
contents:

<p>When both 'width' and 'right' (or 'width' and 'left') are 'auto',
the element's computed width is the width of the contents (using an
algorithm similar to that for table cells) and then 'right' (or
'left') is solved for. CSS2 incorrectly said that 'right' (or 'left') was
set to 0 in that case, and then width was solved for.

<h3 id="s-10-6-4"><a
href="visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-height">Section 10.6.4 Absolutely
positioned, non-replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>Like normal-flow block-level elements, absolutely positioned
elements by default take on the height of their contents
("shrink-wrap"). If 'height' and 'bottom' are both 'auto', the
computed value of 'height' is set to the height of the contents and
then 'bottom' is solved. CSS2 incorrectly said the reverse: 'bottom'
was set to 0 and then height was solved.

<h3 id="c11.1.2"><a href="visufx.html#clipping">Section 11.1.2 Clipping:
the 'clip' property</a></h3>

<p>While CSS2 specified that values of "rect()" give offsets from the
respective sides of the box, current implementations interpret values
with respect to the top and left edges for <em>all</em> four values
(top, right, bottom, and left). This is now the specified
interpretation.

<h3 id="c14.2.1"><a href="colors.html#background-properties">Section
14.2.1 Background properties</a></h3>

<p>For 'background-position', the restriction that keywords cannot
be combined with percentage or length values is removed. I.e., a
value like: '25% top' is now allowed. Also, 'background-position'
now applies to all elements, not just to block-level and replaced
elements.</p>

<p>User agents are no longer allowed to treat a value of 'fixed'
for 'background-attachment' as 'scroll'. Instead they must ignore
all such declarations as if 'fixed' were an invalid value.</p>

<h3 id="c14.3"><a href="colors.html#gamma-correction">Section
14.3 Gamma correction</a></h3>

<p>The contents of this section is now a non-normative note.</p>

<h3 id="c15"><a href="fonts.html">Chapter 15 Fonts</a></h3>

<p>The 'font-stretch' and 'font-size-adjust' properties have
been removed in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<p>Font descriptors, the '@font-face' declaration, and all
associated parts of the font matching algorithm have been
removed in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c15.2"><a href="fonts.html#algorithm">Section 15.2
Font matching algorithm</a></h3>

<p>In this section (previously 15.5), in step 5 (prevously 8)
of the font matching algorith, the UA is now allowed to use
multiple default fallback fonts to find a glyph for a given
character.</p>

<p>In the per-property rule 2, specified that if there is only
a small-caps font in a given family, then that font will be
selected by 'normal'.</p>

<h3 id="c15.3"><a href="fonts.html#font-family-prop">Section 15.2.2 Font family</a></h3>

<p>The "missing character" glyph is no longer considered a match
for the last font in a font set, but is now considered a match
for U+FFFD.</p>

<p>Certain punctuation characters when appearing in unquoted font
family names are now required to be escaped.</p>

<h3 id="c15.5"><a href="fonts.html#small-caps">Section 15.5
Small-caps</a></h3>

<p>The 'font-variant' property's effect is no longer restricted to
bicameral scripts.</p>

<h3 id="c15.6"><a href="fonts.html#font-boldness">Section 15.6
Font boldness</a></h3>

<p>The computed value of 'font-weight' has been defined more
precisely such that the 'bolder' and 'lighter' values have an
appropriate effect when inheriting through elements with
different font-families.</p>

<h3 id="c15.7"><a href="fonts.html#font-size-props">Section 15.7
Font size</a></h3>

<p>Removed suggestion of 1.2 fixed ratio between keyword font
sizes in favor of notes recommending a variable ratio and a
smallest font-size no less than 9 pixels per EM unit.</p>

<p>Added table mapping CSS font-size keywords to HTML font size numbers.</p>

<h3 id="s-17-4-1"><a href="tables.html#q6">17.4.1 Caption position
and alignment</a></h3>

<p>The 'left' and 'right' values on 'caption-side' have been removed.

<h3 id="s-17-5-4"><a href="tables.html#column-alignment">17.5.4
Horizontal alignment in a column</a></h3>

<p>The &lt;string&gt; value for 'text-align' is not part of
CSS&nbsp;2.1.

<h3 id="s-17-6"><a href="tables.html#borders">Section 17.6
Borders</a></h3>

<p>Several popular browsers assume an initial value for
'border-collapse' of 'separate' rather than 'collapse' or exhibit
behavior that is close to that value, even if they do not actually
implement the CSS table model. 'Separate' is now the initial value.

<h3 id="s-12"><a href="generate.html">Chapter 12 Generated content,
automatic numbering, and lists</a></h3>

<p>The 'marker' value for 'display' does not exist in CSS&nbsp;2.1

<h3 id="page"><a href="page.html">Chapter 13 Paged media</a></h3>

<p>The 'size', 'marks' and 'page' properties are not in CSS&nbsp;2.1.

<h3 id="text"><a href="text.html">Chapter 16 Text</a></h3>

<p>The 'text-shadow' property is not in CSS&nbsp;2.1.

<h3 id="a-a"><a href="aural.html">Appendix A. Aural style
sheets</a></h3>

<p>Chapter 19 on aural style sheets has become appendix A and is not
normative in CSS&nbsp;2.1. Related units (deg, grad, rad, ms, s, Hz,
kHz) are also moved to this appendix, as is the 'speak-header'
property from the "tables" chapter and other notes on aural table
rendering. The 'aural' media type is deprecated in favor of the new
'speech' media type.</p>

<h3 id="a-a-5"><a href="aural.html#pause-props">Appendix A Section 5 Pause properties</a></h3>

<p>A note has been added to this section (formerly 19.4) about the change
in position and behavior of pauses in CSS3 Speech compared to this appendix.</p>

<h3 id="a-a-6"><a href="aural.html#cue-props">Appendix A Section 6 Cue properties</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly Section 19.5) now specifies the placement
of cues and pauses with respect to the :before and :after pseudo-elements.</p>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<p>The former informative appendix C, "Implementation and
performance notes for fonts," is left out of CSS&nbsp;2.1.




<h2><a name="known-errors">Errors</a></h2>

<h3 id="x-shorthand-inherit">Shorthand properties</h3>

<p>Shorthand properties take a list of subproperty values <em>or</em>
the value 'inherit'. One cannot mix 'inherit' with other subproperty
values as it would not be possible to specify the subproperty to which
'inherit' applied. The definitions of a number of shorthand properties
did not enforce this rule: 'border-top', 'border-right',
'border-bottom', 'border-left', 'border', 'background', 'font',
'list-style', 'cue', and 'outline'.

<h3 id="x-applies-table">Applies to</h3>

<p>The "applies to" line of many property definitions has been made more
accurate by excluding or including table display types where appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="x6.4"><a href="cascade.html#cascade">Section 6.4 The cascade</a></h3>

<p>Removed paragraph about imported style sheets being overridden by
rules in the importing style sheet: imported style rules follow the
cascade as specified in <a href="cascade.html#cascading-order">6.4.1
Cascading order</a>, exactly as if they were inserted in place of the
@import rule.</p>

<h3 id="x8.1"><a href="box.html#box-dimensions">Section 8.1 Box Dimensions</a></h3>

<p>The definition of "content edge" has been changed to depend on 'width'
and 'height' rather than directly on 'rendered content'.</p>

<p>From the definition of "padding edge", deleted the sentence "The
padding edge of a box defines the edges of the containing block
established by the box." For information about containing
blocks, consult <a href="visudet.html#containing-block-details">
Section 10.1</a>.</p>

<h3 id="x14.2"><a href="colors.html#q2">14.2 The background</a></h3>

<p>Second sentence: "In terms of the box model, 'background' refers to
the background of the content and the padding areas" now also
mentions the border area. (See also <a href="#x60">errata to section
8.1</a> above.) Thus:

<blockquote>
<p>In terms of the box model, "background" refers to the background of
the content, padding and border areas.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x14.2.1"><a href="colors.html#background-properties">14.2.1
Background properties</a></h3>

<p>Under 'background-image', defined the image tile size used when
the background image has intrinsic sizes specified in percentages
or no intrinsic size.</p>

<p>Under 'background-repeat',
the sentence "All tiling covers the content and padding areas [...]"
has been corrected to

<blockquote><p>"All tiling covers the content, padding <ins>and
border</ins> areas [...]".</blockquote>

<p>Under 'background-attachment', the value 'scroll' is defined to
scroll with the "containing block" rather than with the "document".
Also the sentence "Even if the image is fixed [...] background or padding
area of the element" has been corrected to

<blockquote><p>Even if the image is fixed, it is still only visible
when it is in the background, padding <ins>or border</ins> area of the
element.</blockquote>

<h3 id="x15.7"><a href="fonts.html#font-size-props">Section 15.7
Font size</a></h3>

<p>The statement "Negative values are not allowed" for 'font-size'
now applies to percentages as well as lengths.</p>


-------------------

<h3 id="x4.1.1"><a href="syndata.html#tokenization">Section 4.1.1</a> (and
<a href="grammar.html#q2">G2</a>)</h3>

<ul>
<li>The "nmchar" token also allows the range "A-Z".
<li>In the rule for "any" (in the core syntax), changed "FUNCTION"
to "FUNCTION any* ')'".
</ul>

<p id="underscore">The underscore character
("_") is allowed in identifiers. The definitions of the lexical
macros "nmstart" and "nmchar" now include it.

<h3 id="x4.1.3"><a href="syndata.html#q4">4.1.3 Characters and case</a></h3>

<p>In the third bullet, added to point 1:

<blockquote>
<p>1.with a space (or other whitespace character): "\26 B" ("&amp;B") 
</blockquote>

<p>the following text: "In this case, user agents should treat a
"CR/LF" pair (13/10) as a single whitespace character."

<p>The underscore is
allowed in identifiers. Changed "In CSS2, identifiers [...] can contain
only the characters [A-Za-z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters 161 and
higher, plus the hyphen (-)" to:

<blockquote><p>In CSS2, identifiers [...] contain only the characters
[A-Za-z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters 161 and higher, plus the hyphen
(-) and the underscore (_)</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="x4.3"><a href="syndata.html#values">Section 4.3 (Double sign problem)</a></h3>

<p>Several values described in subsections of this section
incorrectly allowed two "+" or "-" signs at their beginnings. 

<h3 id="x4.3.2"><a href="syndata.html#length-units">Section 4.3.2
Lengths</a></h3>

<p>The suggested reference
pixel is based on a <ins>96&nbsp;dpi</ins> device, not 90&nbsp;dpi.
The visual angle is thus about <ins>0.0213 degrees</ins> instead of
0.0227, and a pixel at arm's length is about <ins>0.26&nbsp;mm</ins>
instead of 0.28

<h3 id="x4.3.6"><a href="syndata.html#color-units">Section 4.3.6</a></h3>

<p>Deleted the comments about range
restriction after the following examples:

<pre>
em { color: rgb(255,0,0) }
em { color: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%) }
</pre>

<h3 id="x7"><a href="selector.html#q2">5.10 Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes</a></h3>

<p>In the second bullet, the following sentence was incomplete: "The
exception is ':first-child', which can be deduced from the document
tree." The ':lang()' pseudo-class can be deduced
from the document in some cases.

<h3 id="x8.2"><a href="box.html#mpb-examples">8.2 Example of margins, padding, and borders</a></h3>

<p>The colors in the example HTML did not match the colors in the
image. 

<h3 id="x8.5.2"><a href="box.html#border-color-properties">Section
8.5.2 Border color: 'border-top-color', 'border-right-color',
'border-bottom-color', 'border-left-color', and
'border-color'</a></h3>

<p>The value 'transparent' is 
also allowed on 'border-top-color', 'border-right-color', etc. Changed
the line "Value: &lt;color&gt; | inherit" to

<blockquote><p>Value: &lt;color&gt; | transparent | inherit</blockquote>

<h3 id="x8.4"><a href="box.html#padding-properties">Section 8.4 Padding properties</a></h3>

<p>The five properties related to padding ('padding', 'padding-top',
'padding-right', 'padding-bottom', and 'padding-left') now say that
they don't apply to table rows, row groups, header groups, footer
groups, columns, and column groups.

<h3 id="x8.5.3"><a href="box.html#border-style-properties">8.5.3 Border
style</a></h3>

<p>Changed the sentence "The color of borders drawn for values of
'groove', 'ridge', 'inset', and 'outset' depends on the element's
'color' property" to

<blockquote><p>The color of borders drawn for values of 'groove',
'ridge', 'inset', and 'outset' should be based on the element's
'border-color' property, but UAs may choose their own algorithm to
calculate the actual colors used. For instance, if the 'border-color'
has the value 'silver', then a UA could use a gradient of colors from
white to dark gray to indicate a sloping border.</blockquote>

<h3 id="x8.5.4"><a
href="box.html#border-shorthand-properties">Section 8.5.4 Border
shorthand properties: 'border-top', 'border-bottom', 'border-right',
'border-left', and 'border'</a></h3>

<p>Changed &lt;'border-top-width'&gt; to &lt;border-width&gt; as the first
value option for 'border-top', 'border-right', 'border-bottom',
and 'border-left', and changed &lt;'border-style'&gt; to &lt;border-style&gt;.
For 'border', changed &lt;'border-width'&gt;
to &lt;border-width&gt; and
&lt;'border-style'&gt; to &lt;border-style&gt;.

<p>The value 'transparent' is
also allowed on 'border-top', 'border-bottom', 'border-right',
'border-left', and 'border'.

<p>Changed the two lines "Value: [ &lt;'border-top-width'&gt; ||
&lt;'border-style'&gt; || &lt;color&gt; | inherit" to

<blockquote><p>Value: [ &lt;border-top-width&gt; || &lt;border-style&gt;
|| [&lt;color&gt; | transparent] | inherit</blockquote>

<h3 id="x10"><a href="box.html#value-def-border-width">8.5.4 Border shorthand properties: 'border-top', 'border-bottom', 'border-right', 'border-left', and
    'border'</a></h3>

<p>Changed &lt;'border-top-width'&gt; to &lt;border-width&gt; as the first
value option for 'border-top', 'border-right', 'border-bottom',
and 'border-left', and changed &lt;'border-style'&gt; to &lt;border-style&gt;.
For 'border', changed &lt;'border-width'&gt;
to &lt;border-width&gt; and
&lt;'border-style'&gt; to &lt;border-style&gt;.

<h3 id="x11"><a href="visuren.html#choose-position">Section 9.3.1</a></h3>

<p>The definition of the value 'static' now
says that the properties 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left'
do not apply.

<h3 id="x12"><a href="visuren.html#position-props">Section 9.3.2</a></h3>

<p>The properties 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left', incorrectly
referred to offsets with respect to a box's content edge. The proper edge
is the margin edge. Thus, for 'top', the description now reads:
"This property specifies how far a box's top margin edge is offset
below the top edge of the box's containing block."

<h3 id="x13"><a href="visuren.html#relative-positioning">Section 9.4.3</a></h3>

<p>In the first sentence, added to the end of
"Once a box has been laid out according to the normal flow"
the words "or floated,".

<h3 id="s-9-7"><a href="visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">Section 
9.7 Relationships between 'display', 'position', and 'float'</a></h3>

<p>If an element floats, the
'display' property is set to a block-level value, but not necessarily
'block'. In bullet 3, changed "Otherwise, if 'float' has a value other
than 'none', 'display' is set to 'block' and the box is floated" to a
table with the proper computed values.

<h3 id="x14"><a href="visudet.html#inline-replaced-width">Section 10.3.2 
Inline, replaced elements</a> (and 10.3.4, 10.3.6, and 10.3.8)</h3>

<p>Changed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> A specified value of 'auto' for 'width' gives the element's intrinsic
  width as the computed value.
</blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> If 'width' has a specified value of 'auto' and 'height' also has a
  specified value of 'auto', the element's intrinsic width is the
  computed value of 'width'.  If 'width' has a specified value of
  'auto' and 'height' has some other specified value, then the computed
  value of 'width' is
    (intrinsic width) * ( (computed height) / (intrinsic height) ).
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x15"><a href="visudet.html#blockwidth">Section 10.3.3</a></h3>

<p>In the last sentence of the paragraph following the equation
("If the value of 'direction' is 'ltr', this happens to

<h3 id="x16"><a href="visudet.html#inline-replaced-height">Section 10.6.2 
Inline, replaced elements ...</a> (and 10.6.5)</h3>

<p>Changed:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> If 'height' is 'auto', the computed value
    is the intrinsic height. 
</blockquote>

<p>to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> If 'height' has a specified value of 'auto' and 'width' also has a
  specified value of 'auto', the element's intrinsic height is the
  computed value of 'height'.  If 'height' has a specified value of
  'auto' and 'width' has some other specified value, then the computed
  value of 'height' is
    (intrinsic height) * ( (computed width) / (intrinsic width) ).
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x17"><a href="visudet.html#normal-block">Section 10.6.3</a></h3>

<p>The height calculation for block-level, non-replaced elements in
normal flow, and floating, non-replaced elements was not quite
correct. It now takes into account the case when margins do not
collapse, due to the presence of a padding or border.

<h3 id="x18"><a href="visufx.html#overflow">Section 11.1.1</a></h3>

<p>The example of a DIV element containing a BLOCKQUOTE containing
another DIV was not rendered correctly. The first style rule applied
to both DIVs, so the second DIV box should have been rendered with a
red border as well. The second DIV has now been changed to a CITE,
which doesn't have a red border.

<h3 id="s-11-2"><a href="visufx.html#propdef-visibility">11.2
Visibility: the 'visibility' property</a></h3>

<p>Changed "initial" and
"inherited" to:

<blockquote><p>
<em>Initial:</em> visible<br>
<em>Inherited:</em> yes
</blockquote>

<p>This has the same effect as the original definition, but removes
the undefined state of the root element (which was a problem for DOM
implementations).

<h3 id="x20"><a href="generate.html#lists">12.6.2 Lists</a></h3>

<p>Under the 'list-style' property, the example:</p>

<pre>
ul > ul { list-style: circle outside } /* Any UL child of a UL */
</pre>

<p>could never match valid HTML markup (since a UL element
cannot be a child of another UL element). An LI has been inserted in
between.

<h3 id="x23"><a href="fonts.html#algorithm">Section 15.5</a></h3>

<p>In bullet 2, changed "the UA uses the 'font-family' descriptor"
to "the UA uses the 'font-family' property".

<p>In bullet 6, changed "steps 3, 4 and 5" to
"steps 2, 3, 4 and 5".

<h3 id="s-16-6a"><a href="text.html#propdef-white-space">Section 16.6

<h3 id="x24"><a href="tables.html#q2">Section 17.2 The CSS table

<p>In the definition of <strong>table-header-group</strong>, changed
"footer" to "header" in "Print user agents may repeat footer rows on
each page spanned by a table."

<h3 id="x25"><a href="tables.html#anonymous-boxes">17.2.1 Anonymous table objects </a></h3>

<p>Moved the first bullet text to the prose before the list of

<p>The following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Table cells may be relatively and absolutely positioned, but this is not recommended: positioning and floating remove a

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>has been amended as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Table cells may be 
positioned, but this is not recommended: absolute and fixed
positioning, as well as floating, remove a box from the flow, affecting
table size.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x27"><a href="tables.html#q7">17.5 Visual layout of table

</blockquote>

<p>to:

<blockquote>
<p>Like other elements of the document language, internal table

</blockquote>

<h3 id="s-17-5-1"><a href="tables.html#table-layers">Section 17.5.1
Table layers and transparency</a></h3>

<p>The rows and columns only cover the whole table in the collapsed

row groups and column groups in terms of the cells they cover.

<h3 id="x28"><a href="tables.html#separated-borders">Section 17.6.1 The

<p>The underscore character
("_") is be allowed in identifiers. The definitions of the lexical
macros "nmstart" and "nmchar" have been fixed.

<p>Note that the tokenizer is case-insensitive, so uppercase A-Z is

<p>The specification for the <a

style sheet PI</a>
was written after CSS2 was finalized. The first line of the full XML

<pre>&lt;?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="bach.css"?&gt;</pre>

<h3 id="r3.1"><a href="conform.html#defs">Definitions</a></h3>

<p>Added a note to clarify that the deprecated/non-deprecated status
of a feature is distinct from its normative/non-normative status.</p>

<p>Under 'document language' clarified that CSS only describes the
presentation of a document language, and has no effect on its semantics.</p>

<p>Changed definition of 'replaced element' to "an element whose content
is outside the scope of the CSS formatting model" and added further clarifying
text. This clarifies that e.g. SVG images embedded in an XML document are
also considered replaced elements, not just those linked in from an outside
file. Also changed definition of 'rendered content' to be consistent with this
clarification.</p>

<p>Added definition for 'ignore'.</p>

<p>Added definition for 'HTML user agent'.</p>

<p>Added definition for 'property'.</p>

<h3 id="x54"><a href="syndata.html#tokenization">Section 4.1.1</a></h3>

<p>DELIM should not have included single or double quote. Refer also
to section 4.1.6 on strings, which must have matching single or
double quotes around them.

<h3 id="x55"><a href="selector.html#descendant-selectors">Section 5.5</a></h3>

<p>Near the end of the section, the text 'Note the whitespace on
either side of the "*"' was misleading. The note was not meant to
imply that whitespace is required on both sides of the "*" (since the
grammar does not require it in this case) but that one may use
whitespace in this case.

<h3 id="x56"><a href="selector.html#id-selectors">Section 5.9 ID selectors</a></h3>

<p>The word "precedence" in the last but one paragraph should have been
"specificity."

<h3 id="s-5-12-1"><a href="selector.html#first-line-pseudo">Section

<h3 id="r6.2"><a href="cascade.html#inheritance">Section 6.2 Inheritance</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that computed values are inherited (not specified values)

<p>Removed discussion of "default" styles for a document.</p>

<h3 id="r6.2.1"><a href="cascade.html#value-def-inherit">Section 6.2.1 The 'inherit' value</a></h3>

<p>Clarify that 'inherit' can be used on properties that are not normally inherited

property's initial value.</p>

<h3 id="r6.3"><a href="cascade.html#at-import">Section 6.3 The @import rule</a></h3>

<p>Except @charset from the statement that @imports must precede all other rules.</p>

<p>Various editorial changes to clarify sort order.</p>

<h3 id="x59"><a href="cascade.html#specificity">Section 6.4.3 Calculating a

<p>Added a note:

<blockquote><p>The specificity is based only on the form of the selector.
In particular, a selector of the form "<code>[id=p33]</code>" is
counted as an attribute selector (a=0, b=1, c=0), even if the

document's DTD.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="s-7-3"><a href="media.html#media-types">Section 7.3 Recognized

<p>Text has been added to clarify that media types are mutually

<h3 id="r8.1"><a href="box.html#box-dimensions">Section 8.1 Box dimensions</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>The terms "content box", "padding box", "border box", and "margin box"
have been defined.
<li>Border backgrounds are not specified by border properties. Changed
the last paragraph of 8.1 to:
<blockquote>
<p>The background style of the content, padding, and border areas of a
box is specified by the <span
class="propinst-background">'background'</span> property of the
generating element. Margin backgrounds are always transparent.
</blockquote>
<li>Removed definition of "box width" and "height".
</ul>

<h3 id="r8.3"><a href="box.html#margin-properties">Section 8.3 Margin properties</a></h3>

<p>Added a sentence to note that vertical margins have no effect on non-replaced
inline elements.</p>

<h3 id="r8.3.1"><a href="box.html#collapsing-margins">Section 8.3.1</a></h3>

<p>Changed "absolute maximum" to "maximum of the absolute values" in
sentence about negative margins collapsing.</p>

<p>Added this clarifying note to the first bullet of the explanation
of vertical collapsing of margins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Adjoining boxes may be generated by
elements that are not related as siblings or ancestors.
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasized that floating elements' margins do not collapse even between a float
and its in-flow children.</p>

<p>Emphasized that absolutely positioned elements' margins do not collapse even between
the positioned element and its in-flow children.</p>

<h3 id="r8.5.3"><a href="box.html#border-color-properties">Section 8.5.3 Border style</a></h3>

<p>Made it unclear whether 'border-style: none' forces a used or computed value of zero for 'border-width'.</p>

<h3 id="x62"><a href="visuren.html#inline-formatting">Section 9.4.2</a></h3>

<p>The statement "When an inline box is split, margins, borders, and
padding have no visual effect where the split occurs." has been
generalized. Margins, borders, and padding have no visual effect
where one or more splits occur.

<h3 id="x63"><a href="visuren.html#relative-positioning">Section 9.4.3</a></h3>

<p>Relatively positioned boxes do not always establish new containing
blocks. Changed the second paragraph accordingly.

<p>Added clarifying text and an example about the 'left',
'right', 'top' and 'bottom' properties for relative positioning.

<h3 id="x64"><a href="visuren.html#direction">Section 9.10</a></h3>

<p>In this sentence of the last paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conforming HTML user agents may therefore ignore the 'direction'
and 'unicode-bidi' properties in author and user style sheets.
</blockquote>

<p>the word "ignore" meant that if a 'unicode-bidi' or 'direction'
value conflicts with the HTML 4 "dir" attribute value, then user
agents may choose to use the "dir" value rather than the CSS
properties.

<p>User agents are not required to support the <span
class="propinst-direction">'direction'</span> and <span
class="propinst-unicode-bidi">'unicode-bidi'</span> properties to
conform to CSS2 unless they support bi-directional text rendering
(except for the case of HTML 4 as noted above).

<p>The sentence has been rewritten to be clearer.

<h3 id="s-10-3-3"><a href="visudet.html#blockwidth">10.3.3 Block-level,
non-replaced elements in normal flow</a></h3>

<p>Added the following note at
the end of the section:

<blockquote><p>Note that 'width' may not be greater than 'max-width' and
not less than 'min-width'. In particular, it may not be negative. See
the rules in section 10.4 below.</blockquote>

<h3 id="s-10-5"><a href="visudet.html#the-height-property">Section
10.5 Content height: the 'height' property</a></h3>

<p>The UA is free to chose the containing block for the root element
(see 10.1), therefore this sentence has been added as a suggestion:

<blockquote>
<p>A UA may compute a percentage height on the root element relative
to the viewport.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x65"><a href="visudet.html#propdef-line-height">Section 10.8.1</a></h3>

<p>Clarified this paragraph:

<blockquote>
<p>Note that replaced elements have a 'font-size' and a 'line-height'
property, even if they are not used directly to determine the height
of the box. The 'font-size' is, however, used to define the 'em' and
'ex' units, and the 'line-height' has a role in the 'vertical-align'
property.
</blockquote>

<p>as follows:

<blockquote>
<p>Note that replaced elements have a <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span> and a <span
class="propinst-line-height">'line-height'</span> property, even if
they are not used directly to determine the height of the box: 'em'
and 'ex' values are relative to values of <span
class="propinst-font-size">'font-size'</span> and percentage values
for <span class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span> are
relative to values of <span
class="propinst-line-height">'line-height'</span>.
</blockquote>

<p>Under 'line-height', after
the sentence "If the property is set on a block-level element whose
content is composed of inline-level elements, it specifies the
<em>minimal</em> height of each generated inline box," added the
following clarification:

<blockquote><p>The minimum height consist of a minimum height above
the block's baseline and a minimum depth below it, exactly as if each
line box starts with a zero-width inline box with the block's font and
line height properties (what T<sub>E</sub>X calls a
"strut").</blockquote>

<h3 id="x66"><a href="visufx.html#overflow-clipping">Section 11.1</a></h3>

<p>Clarifications to the last two bullets on when overflow may
occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>A descendent box is positioned
absolutely partly outside of the box.
<li>A descendent box has negative margins, causing it
to be positioned partly outside the box.
</ul>

<h3 id="x67"><a href="visufx.html#overflow">Section 11.1.1</a></h3>

<p>Removed 'projection' from this sentence under the value 'scroll'

<blockquote>
<p>
When this value is specified and the target medium is 'print' or 'projection', overflowing content should be printed. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x68"><a href="visufx.html#clipping">Section 11.1.2</a></h3>

<p>Values of "rect()" should be separated by commas. Thus, the
definition of &lt;shape&gt; now starts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In CSS2, the only valid &lt;shape&gt; value is: rect (&lt;top&gt;, &lt;right&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;,
&lt;left&gt;) ...
</blockquote>

<p>Due to this ambiguity, user agents may support separation of
offsets in "rect()" with or without commas.

<h3 id="x69"><a href="generate.html#before-after-content">12.1 The
:before and :after pseudo-elements</a></h3>

<p>There are no restrictions anymore on which which properties or
property values are allowed on ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="s-12-4-2">Section 12.4.2 Inserting quotes with the 'content'
property</h3>

<p>Added the following sentence
at the end of the 2nd paragraph:

<blockquote><p>A 'close-quote' that would make the depth negative is
in error and is ignored: the depth stays at 0 and no quote mark is
rendered (although the rest of the 'content' property's value is still
inserted).
</blockquote>

<h3 id="r14.2"><a href="colors.html#q2">Section 14.2 The background</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that the root background image, although painted over the entire
canvas, is anchored as if painted only for the root element, and that the root's
background is only painted once.</p>

<p>Clarified rules for propagation of background settings on HTML's &lt;body>
element to the root.</p>

<p>Added statement about z-index of backgrounds for elements that form a
stacking context and referred to z-index property for details.</p>

<p>Added this note after the first paragraph after 'background-attachment':

<blockquote><p>Note that there is only <em>one</em> viewport per
document. I.e., even if an element has a scrolling mechanism (see
'overflow'), a 'fixed' background doesn't move with it.</blockquote>

<p>Definition of 'background-position' has been rewritten as normative rules
rather than just examples.</p>

<p>Stated that the tiling and positioning of background images for inline
elements is undefined in CSS2.1.</p>

<h3 id="r15.1"><a href="fonts.html#q1">Section 15.1 Fonts Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Drastically shortened introduction.</p>

<h3 id="c15.2"><a href="fonts.html#algorithm">Section 15.2
Font matching algorithm</a></h3>

<p>In the per-property rule 2, clarified that 'normal' matches
the non-small-caps variant (if there is one).</p>

<h3 id="r15.3"><a href="fonts.html#font-family-prop">Section 15.2.2 Font family</a></h3>

<p>Removed discussion of font-matching algorithm. (It is already
covered in the <a href="fonts.html#algorithm">font-matching algorithm's
own section</a>.</p>

<p>Clarified that quoted strings that are the same as a keyword
value must be treated as font family names and not as the keyword
value (which must be unquoted).</p>

<h3 id="r15.3.1"><a href="fonts.html#generic-font-families">Section 15.3.1
Generic font families</a></h3>

<p>This section, previously section 15.2.6, has been moved but no
other change was made.</p>

<h3 id="r15.4"><a href="fonts.html#font-styling">Section 15.4
Font styling</a></h3>

<p>The text for this section (formerly part of 15.2.3) has been
reverted to its CSS1 format.</p>

<h3 id="r15.5"><a href="fonts.html#small-caps">Section 15.5
Small-caps</a></h3>

<p>The text for this section (formerly part of 15.2.3) has been
reverted to its CSS1 format.</p>

<p>Clarified that CSS2.1 cannot select font variants besides small-caps.</p>

<p>Clarified that when "font-variant: small-caps" results in the
substitution of full-caps, the behavior is the same as for
text-transform.</p>

<h3 id="r15.6"><a href="fonts.html#font-boldness">Section 15.6
Font boldness</a></h3>

<p>The text for this section (formerly part of 15.2.3) has been
reverted to its CSS1 format. Also, discussion of font-weight from
other parts of the Fonts chapter has been aggregated under this
section.</p>

<p>Removed statemnt that says "User agents must map names to values
in a way that preserves visual order; a face mapped to a value
must not be lighter than faces mapped to lower values." This is
otherwise implied by "The only guarantee is that a face of a given
value will be no less dark than the faces of lighter values."</p>

<h3 id="r15.7"><a href="fonts.html#font-size-props">Section 15.7

<p>Clarified relationship of font size to em squares.</p>

<p>Added a totally irrelevant note about font sizes virtual reality
scenes.</p>

<h3 id="x76"><a href="text.html#indentation-prop">Section 16.1</a></h3>

<p>Added to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The value of 'text-indent' may be negative, but there may be
implementation-specific limits.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the following clarification: "If the value of 'text-indent'
is negative, the value of 'overflow' will affect whether the
text is visible."

<h3 id="x77"><a href="text.html#alignment-prop">16.2 Alignment: the 'text-align' property</a></h3>

<p>Changed "double justify" to "justify" under "left, right, center,
and justify".

<h3 id="x78"><a href="tables.html#table-layers">Section 17.5.1 Table layers and
transparency</a></h3>

<p>In point 6, changed 'These
"empty" cells are transparent' to:

<blockquote>
<p>If the value of their 'empty-cells' property is 'hide'
these "empty" cells are transparent through the cell, row, row group,
column, and column group backgrounds, letting the table background
show through.</blockquote>

<p>To remove ambiguity about the position of backgrounds on rows and
column, the following paragraph was added after point 6:

<blockquote><p>the edges of the rows, columns, row groups and column
groups in the <a href="tables.html#collapsing-borders">collapsing borders
model</a> coincide with the hypothetical grid lines on which the
borders of the cells are centered. (And thus, in this model, the rows
together exactly cover the table, leaving no gaps; ditto for the
columns.) In the <a href="tables.html#separated-borders">separated borders
model,</a> the edges coincide with the <a
href="box.html#border-edge">border edges</a> of cells. (And thus, in
this model, there may be gaps between the rows and columns,
corresponding to the <span
class="propinst-border-spacing">'border-spacing'</span>
property.)</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the section
added the following paragraph:

<blockquote><p>Note that if the table has 'border-collapse: separate',
the background of the area given by the 'border-spacing' property is
always the background of the table element. See 17.6.1</blockquote>

<h3 id="table-width"><a href="tables.html#width-layout">Section 17.5.2 Table width algorithms</a></h3>

<p>Added the following paragraph after the initial paragraph of this
section:

<blockquote>
<p>Note that this section overrides the rules that apply to
calculating widths as described in <a
href="visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins">section 10.3</a>. In
particular, if the margins of a table are set to '0' and the width to
'auto', the table will not automatically size to fill its containing
block. However, once the calculated value of 'width' for the table is
found (using the algorithms given below or, when appropriate, some
other UA dependant algorithm) then the other parts of section 10.3
do apply. Therefore a table can be centered using left and right
'auto' margins, for instance.
</blockquote>

<p>The WG may introduce ways of automatically making tables fit their
containing blocks in CSS3.

<h3 id="s-17-6-1"><a href="tables.html#separated-borders">17.6.1 The separated borders model</a></h3>

<p>Added clarification about alignment of row/column backgrounds. The
sentence "This space is filled with the background of the table
element" was replaced by:

<blockquote><p>In this space, the row, column, row group, and column
group backgrounds are invisible, allowing the table background to show
through.</blockquote>

<h3 id="x79"><a href="tables.html#empty-cells">Borders around empty cells: the
'empty-cells' property</a></h3>

<p>The 'empty-cells' property 
not only controls the borders, but also the background.

<h3 id="x80"><a href="tables.html#collapsing-borders">Section 17.6.2 The
collapsing borders model</a></h3>

<p>In the sentence after the question, added "and
padding-left<sub>i</sub> and padding-right<sub>i</sub> refer 
to the left (resp., right) padding of cell i."

<h3 id="x81"><a href="ui.html#system-colors">Section 18.2</a></h3>

<p>For the 'ButtonHighlight' value, changed the description
from "Dark shadow" to "Highlight color".

<h3 id="x82"><a href="aural.html#speaking-props">Section A.3</a></h3>

<p>The parenthetical phrase "somewhat analogous to the 'display' property"
was misleading. The 'speak' property resembles 'visibility' in
some ways and 'display' in others.

<h3 id="x84"><a href="grammar.html#q2">Appendix G.2 Lexical scanner</a></h3>

<p>Removed the following line from the scanner as it
does not appear in the grammar:</p>

<pre>
"@"{ident}              {return ATKEYWORD;}
</pre>

<p>The DIMEN token is in the scanner to ensure that a number followed
by an identifier is read as one token rather than two. This case
is considered an error in CSS2.

<h3 id="refs"><a href="refs.html">Appendix E. References</a></h3>

<p>The entry for "[URI]" referred to a draft that has become an RFC.
The entry has been changed.
