<P><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></P>

<P>CSS&nbsp;2.1 is an updated revision of CSS2. The changes between the
CSS2 specification (see [[CSS2]]) and this specification fall into
five groups: known errors, typographical errors, clarifications,
changes and additions. Typographical errors are not listed here.</P>

<p>This chapter is not a complete list of changes. Minor editorial
changes and most changes to examples are also not listed here.</p>


<h2><a name="new">Additional property values</a></h2>

<h3 id="s-4-3-5"><a href="syndata.html#color-units">Section 4.3.5

<h3 id="s-12-2a"><a href="generate.html#content">Section 12.2 The
'content' property</a></h3>

<p>New 'content' values 'none' and 'normal'. (The values 'none' and
'normal' are equivalent in CSS&nbsp;2.1, but may have different
functions in CSS3.)

<h2><a name="changes">Changes</a></h2>

<h3 id="c1.1"><a href="about.html#q1">Section 1.1 CSS 2.1 vs CSS 2</a></h3>

<p>This new section is added to explain the motivation for CSS2.1
and its relation to CSS2.</p>

<h3 id="c1.2"><a href="about.html#q2">Section 1.2 Reading the specification</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly Section 1.1) has been marked non-normative.</p>

<h3 id="c1.3"><a href="about.html#q3">Section 1.3 How the specification is organized</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly Section 1.2) has been marked non-normative.</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.2.1"><a href="about.html#q7">Section 1.4.2.1 Value</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly unnumbered under 1.3.2) notes that value types are specified
in terms of tokens and that spaces may appear between tokens in values. A note
explains that spaces are required between some tokens.</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.2.6"><a href="about.html#q12">Section 1.4.2.6 Media groups</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly unnumbered under 1.3.2) now declares the Media line
in property definitions to be non-normative.</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.2.7"><a href="about.html#q13">Section 1.4.2.7 Computed value</a></h3>

<p>A new line is added to each property definition specifying what the computed
values are for the property. (This defines what level of computation is done to
a property value before inheritance and before certain other calculations.)</p>

<h3 id="c1.4.4"><a href="about.html#q15">Section 1.4.4 Notes and examples</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly 1.3.4) now specifies that HTML examples lacking DOCTYPE
declarations are SGML Text Entities conforming to the HTML 4.01 Strict DTD [HTML4].
The markup for many examples has been reformulated to either include a DOCTYPE or
conform to this definition.</p>

<h3 id="c1.5"><a href="about.html#q17">Section 1.5 Acknowledgements</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly 1.4) has been updated to reflect contributions to CSS2.1
and has been marked non-normative.<p>

<h3 id="c3.2"><a href="conform.html#conformance">Section 3.2
Conformance</a></h3>

<p>Support for user style sheets is now required (in most cases),
rather than just recommended.

<p>Support for turning of author style sheets is now required.</p>

<p>Application of CSS properties to form controls is explicitly undefined.
Authors are recommended to treat form control styling capabilities in UAs
as experimental.</p>

<h3 id="c3.3"><a href="conform.html#q3">Section 3.3
Error Conditions</a></h3>

<p>This section changed to say that error handling <em>is</em> specified
in most cases.</p>




<!-- Chapter 5 -->

<h3 id="c5.8.1"><a href="selector.html#q10">Section 5.8.1 Matching
attributes and attribute values</a></h3>

<p>RFC&nbsp;3066 replaces RFC&nbsp;1766.

<h3 id="c5.8.3"><a href="selector.html#class-html">Section 5.8.3 Class
selectors</a></h3>

<p>Class selectors are allowed for other formats than HTML.

<p>Added a note about matching classes in formats with multiple class
attributes per element. The behavior is non-normative, because, at the
time of writing, there exist no such formats.

<h3 id="c5.9"><a href="selector.html#id-selectors">Section 5.9 ID
selectors</a></h3>

<p>Specified how to match elements with two or more ID attributes.

<h3 id="c5.10"><a href="selectors.html#pseudo-elements">Section 5.10
Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes</a></h3>

<p>Removed exception for HTML UAs that allowed them (and only them) to
ignore ':first-letter' and ':first-line'.

<h3 id="c5.11.2"><a href="selectors.html#link-pseudo-classes">5.11.2
The link pseudo-classes: :link and :visited</a></h3>

<p>UAs may return a :visited link to :link status at some point. (This
was previously a note, but is now normative.)

<p>Added a note about privacy concerns with link pseudo classes and
allowed UAs to treat :visited as :link.

<h3 id="c5.11.4"><a href="selectors.html#lang">Section 5.11.4 The
language pseudo-class: :lang</a></h3>

<p>The identifier C in ':lang(C)' need not be a valid language code,
but it must not be empty.

<h3 id="c5.12.1"><a href="selector.html#first-line-pseudo">Section
5.12.1 The :first-line pseudo-element</a></h3>

<p>':first-line' also applies to inline blocks, table captions and
table cells. Added a definition of "first formatted line" to make the
rules about which line is the first line more precise.

<p>UAs are no longer forbidden from applying more properties than the
given list.

<h3 id="c5.12.2"><a href="selector.html#first-letter">Section 5.12.2
The :first-letter pseudo-element</a></h3>

<p>More precise definition of first letter. Added rules for cases
where the first letter is in an inline block or table cell. Added
rules for cases when preceding punctuation is in a different element
from the first letter itself.

<p>UAs may apply other properties to first letters than the given
list.

<p>Unicode character classes Pi and Pf added to the definition of
punctuation.



<!-- Chapter 6 -->

<h3 id="c6.1"><a href="cascade.html#q1">Section 6.1 Specified, computed, and actual values</a></h3>

<p>Redefined "computed value" and created the concept of "used value"
so that inheritance can be performed without laying out the document.
This change has the effect of allowing (requiring) percentages to be inherited
as percentages and affects many other layout calculations throughout the spec.</p>

<p>Since computed value of a property can now also be a percentage. In
particular, the following properties now inherit the percentage if the
specified value is a percentage:

<ul>
<li>background-position
<li>bottom, left, right, top
<li>height, width
<li>margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right, margin-top,
<li>min-height, min-width
<li>padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right, padding-top
<li>text-indent
</ul>

<p>Note that only 'text-indent' inherits by default, the others only
inherit if the 'inherit' keyword is specified.

<h3 id="c6.4.1"><a href="cascade.html#cascading-order">Section 6.4.1 Cascading order</a></h3>

<p>Changed suggestion that user be able to turn off author styles to a requirement.</p>

<h3 id="c6.4.3"><a href="cascade.html#specificity">Section 6.4.3
Calculating a selector's specificity</a></h3>

<p>The "style" attribute now has a higher specificity than any style
rule.</p>

<p>Pseudo-elements are now counted with elements in calculating a
a selector's specificity.</p>

<h3 id="c6.4.4"><a href="cascade.html#q13">Section 6.4.4 Precedence
of non-CSS presentational hints</a></h3>

<p>"Non-CSS presentational hints" no longer exist, with the exception
of a small set of attributes in HTML.</p>

<h3 id="c7.3"><a href="media.html#media-types">Section 7.3
Recognized Media Types</a></h3>

<p>Added 'speech' media type.</p>

<p>Marked "Media" field in property descriptions informative.</p>

<h3 id="c7.3.1"><a href="media.html#media-types">Section 7.3.1
Media Groups</a></h3>

<p>Marked this section informative.</p>

<p>Added sound to 'handheld' in media type/media group table.</p>

<p>Changed 'tactile' to be both 'static' and 'interactive'.</p>

<h3 id="c8.3"><a href="box.html#margin-properties">Section 8.3 Margin properties</a></h3>

<p>If the containing block's width depends on an element with percentage
margins, then the resulting layout is undefined in CSS 2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c8.3.1"><a href="box.html#collapsing-margins">Section 8.3.1 Collapsing margins</a></h3>

<p>In the definition of "collapsing margins", added "non-empty content"
and "clearance" to the parenthetical list of things that prevent consecutive
margins from being adjoining.</p>

<p>Vertical margins of elements with 'overflow' other than 'visible' no longer
collapse with their in-flow children.</p>

<p>Defined how margins collapse through an element with adjoining top and
bottom margins.</p>

<p>Added that margins of the root element's box do not collapse.</p>

<p>More rigorously <a href="box.html#what-is-adjoining">defined "adjoining" for margin collapsing</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c8.4"><a href="box.html#padding-properties">Section 8.4 Padding properties</a></h3>

<p>If the containing block's width depends on an element with percentage
padding, then the resulting layout is undefined in CSS 2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c8.5.2"><a href="box.html#border-color-properties">Section 8.5.2 Border color</a></h3>

<p>'transparent' can now be specified independently for each border side,
on par with &lt;color>.</p>

<h3 id="c8.5.3"><a href="box.html#border-style-properties">Section 8.5.3 Border style</a></h3>

<p>3D border styles ('groove', 'ridge', 'inset', 'outset') now depend on the
corresponding border-color rather than on 'color'.</p>

<h3 id="c8.6"><a href="box.html#q11">Section 8.6 The box model for inline elements in bidirection context</a></h3>

<p>Added this new section to specify layout of inline boxes when affected by bidi.</p>

<h3 id="c9.1.2"><a href="visuren.html#containing-block">Section 9.1.2
Containing blocks</a></h3>

<p>Removed paragraphs about the initial containing block, as this is
now defined differently. (See <a href="#initial-containing-block">changes
to section 10.1</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="c9.2.1.1"><a href="visuren.html#anonymous-block-level">Section 9.2.1.1
Anonymous block boxes</a></h3>

<p>Added a paragraph to define formatting when an inline box contains
a block box.</p>

<p>Specified what property values are applied to anonymous boxes.</p>

<h3 id="c9.2.2.1"><a href="visuren.html#anonymous">Section 9.2.2.1
Anonymous inline boxes</a></h3>

<p>Specified that collapsed whitespace does not generate anonymous
inline boxes.</p>

<h3 id="c9.2.3"><a href="visuren.html#run-in">Section 9.2.3
Run-in boxes</a></h3>

<p>Changed run-in rules so that a) run-ins that contain blocks become blocks
b) run-ins can only run into sibling blocks and c) run-ins cannot run into
other run-ins.</p>

<h3 id="c9.2.4"><a href="visuren.html#display-prop">Section 9.2.4
The 'display' property</a></h3>

<p>The 'marker' and 'compact' values of the 'display' property are
not part of CSS&nbsp;2.1. Text relating to these values has been
removed throughout the specification.</p>

<p>Defined the computed value of 'display' as the specified value
except for positioned and floating elements and for the root element.
The computed value of 'display' for these elements is defined in
<a href="visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">section 9.7</a> and is slightly
different from the definition in CSS2.</p>

<p>Conforming HTML UAs are no longer allowed to ignore the 'display'
property.</p>

<h3 id="c9.3.1"><a href="visuren.html#choose-position">Section 9.3.1
Choosing a positioning scheme</a></h3>

<p>The 'position' property now applies to all elements, including
generated content.</p>

<p>The effect of relative positioning on table captions and internal
table elements is undefined in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<p>For fixed positioning, introduced a conflict between this section
and section 10.1 rule 3.
See <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-css-wg/2003AprJun/0172.html">howcome</a>
for rationale.</p>

<p>Forbid UAs from paginating the content of fixed boxes.</p>

<p>UAs are allowed to treat all values of 'position' as 'static' on
the root element.</p>

<h3 id="c9.3.2"><a href="visuren.html#position-props">Section 9.3.2
Box offsets</a></h3>

<p>Defined computed values of 'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left' based
on the value of 'position'.</p>

<p>Percentage offsets are no longer undefined for containing blocks
without an explicit height.</p>

<h3 id="c9.4.1"><a href="visuren.html#block-formatting">Section 9.4.1
Block formatting contexts</a></h3>

<p>Specified that floats, absolutely positioned elements, inline-blocks,
table-cells, table-captions, and elements with 'overflow' other than
'visible' establish new block formatting contexts.</p>

<p>In the paragraph about the position of a box's outer edge with respect
to its containing block, except boxes that establish a new block formatting
context, as they may become narrower due to floats.</p>

<h3 id="c9.4.2"><a href="visuren.html#inline-formatting">Section 9.4.2
Inline formatting context</a></h3>

<p>Specified that the effect of 'justify' on the content of a line box
does not affect the contents of inline-table and inline-block boxes.</p>

<p>Empty line boxes are now required to be treated as zero-height and
ignored in margin collapsing.</p>

<h3 id="c9.4.3"><a href="visure.html#relative-positioning">Section 9.4.3
Relative positioning</a></h3>

<p>Added several paragraphs and an example to explain exactly what the
computed values of relatively-positioned offsets are, how they affect
each other, and what happens when the positioning is overconstrained.
(These were not previously defined.)</p>

<h3 id="c9.5"><a href="visuren.html#floats">Section 9.5
Floats</a></h3>

<p>Floats are no longer required to have an explicit width.</p>

<p>Floats outside of line boxes no longer align to the bottom of
the preceding block box; it is implied that they are initially
aligned with their non-floated position.</p>

<p>Specified that "If a shortened line box is too small to contain any
further content, then it is shifted downward until either it fits or
there are no more floats present."</p>

<p>Specified that the border box of a table, block-level replaced element,
or element in the normal flow that establishes a new block formatting
context must not overlap any floats in the same block formatting context.</p>

<h3 id="c9.5.1"><a href="visuren.html#float-position">Section 9.5.1
Positioning the float</a></h3>

<p>The 'float' property now also applies to :before/:after and generated
content.</p>

<p>UAs are now allowed to treat all values of float as 'none' on the
root element.</p>

<p>Added to rule 4 prose to define the position of a float when it
occurs between two collapsing margins.</p>

<h3 id="c9.5.2"><a href="visuren.html#flow-control">Section 9.5.2
Controlling flow next to floats</a></h3>

<p>Defined <em>clearance</em> to precisely detail the 'clear' property's
effect on margin collapsing and the block's cleared position.</p>

<p>Added note to explain effect of 'clear' on inline elements since
CSS1 (but not CSS2 or CSS&nbsp;2.1) allows 'clear' on inline elements.</p>

<h3 id="c9.7"><a href="visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">Section 9.7
Relationships between 'display', 'position', and 'float'</a></h3>

<p>Changed rules to convert 'display' not always to 'block', but
to an appropriate block-level display value as given by a mapping
table.</p>

<p>Added rule 4 to convert root element's 'display' value according
to the mapping.</p>

<h3 id="c9.9"><a href="visuren.html#q29">Section 9.9
Layered presentation</a></h3>

<p>Specified that the background and borders of an element that forms
a stacking context are behind all of its descendants, altered stacking
context prose to be more precise, and added a normative
<a href="zindex.html">Appendix E: Elaborate description of Stacking
Contexts</a> to be even more precise about the position of borders,
backgrounds, and content on the z-axis.</p>

<h3 id="c9.10"><a href="visuren.html#direction">Section 9.10
Text direction</a></h3>

<p>Conforming UAs are now allowed to not support bidirectional text; in
this case they must ignore the 'direction' and 'unicode-bidi' properties.
However since applying bidi can have an effect even when a document
doesn't contain right-to-left characters, UAs that do support bidi are
no longer permitted to not apply the algorithm just because the document
lacks right-to-left characters.</p>

<p>Added a paragraph to define precisely how the Unicode bidirectional
algorithm applies to text in the CSS formatting model and how the CSS
'direction' property on blocks maps into the algorithm.</p>

<p>Conforming HTML UAs are no longer exempt from supporting 'direction'
and 'unicode-bidi'.</p>

<h3 id="c10"><a href="visudet.html">Chapter
Visual formatting model details</a></h3>

<p>Updated prose to use the terms "specified", "computed" and "used"
as appropriate when referencing values. This affects many calculations
in this section. (See <a href="#c6.1">changes to section 6.1</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="c10.1"><a href="visudet.html#containing-block-details">Section 10.1
Definition of "containing block"</a></h3>

<p id="initial-containing-block">In rule 1, defined the initial
containing block as the viewport for continuous media and the page
area for paged media. (It was previously undefined.)</p>

<p>In rule 2, defined the page area as the containing block for fixed
positioned elements in paged media.</p>

<p>In rule 4.1, when the containing block of an absolutely-positioned
element is formed by an inline-level element, it is now formed by that
element's padding edges, not its content edges.</p>

<p>In rule 4, changed the containing block for absolutely positioned
elements with only statically positioned elements from the root's
content box to the initial containing block.</p>

<p>Specified the positioning and breaking behavior of absolutely-positioned
elements in paged media.</p>

<h3 id="c10.2"><a href="visudet.html#the-width-property">Section 10.2
Content width</a></h3>

<p>Declared that if the containing block's width depends on an element's
percentage width, then the resulting layout is undefined in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3"><a href="visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins">Section 10.3
Calculating widths and margins</a></h3>

<p>The computed values of 'left' and 'right' for are now defined in
<a href="visuren.html#position-props">section 9.3.2</a>. The value
'auto' does not always compute to zero.</p>

<p>Added sections 10.3.9 and 10.3.10 to define calculations for inline blocks.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.2"><a href="visudet.html#inline-replaced-width">Section 10.3.2
Inline, replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>The sizing algorithm for replaced elements now takes into account and
attempts to preserve the replaced content's intrinsic ratio. Sizing of
replaced elements with percentage intrinsic sizes and without intrinsic
sizes is now also defined.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.3"><a href="visudet.html#blockwidth">Section 10.3.3
Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow</a></h3>

<p>Added the vertical scrollbar width to the horizontal constraint equation.</p>

<p>Specified that a computed total of the width, padding, and borders
that is greater than the containing block width causes auto margins to
be treated as zero in the rest of the rules. This avoids 'auto' margins
being negative on the start edge.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.4"><a href="visudet.html#q7">Section 10.3.4
Block-level, replaced elements in normal flow</a></h3>

<p>Applied changes to section 10.3.2 and section 10.3.3 to block-level
replaced elements in normal flow by referring to the calculations in
those sections.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.5"><a href="visudet.html#q8">Section 10.3.5
Floating, non-replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>Defined computations for 'auto' width floats as shrink-to-fit.
(Floats were previously required to have fixed widths.)</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.6"><a href="visudet.html#q9">Section 10.3.6
Floating, replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>Applied changes to section 10.3.2 to this section by referencing
it for 'auto' width calculations.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.7"><a href="visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-width">Section 10.3.7
Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>Defined the static position of an element more precisely.</p>

<p>Added vertical scrollbar width to the horizontal restraint equation.</p>

<p>Rewrote constraint rules.</p>

<h3 id="c10.3.8"><a href="visudet.html#abs-replaced-width">Section 10.3.8
Absolutely positioned, replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>In rule 1, applied sizing rules from section 10.3.2.</p>

<p>In rule 2 (formerly rules 2 and 3), referred to new definition of
'static position' in section 10.3.7.</p>

<p>In rule 4 (formerly rule 5), prevented 'auto' left and right margins
in resulting in a negative margin on the start edge.</p>

<h3 id="c10.4"><a href="visudet.html#min-max-widths">Section 10.4
Minimum and maximum widths</a></h3>

<p>Specified that if the containing block's width is negative, the
used value of a percentage min/max width is zero.</p>

<p>Specified that if the min/max width is specified in percentages and
the containing block's width depends on this element's width, then the
resulting layout is undefined in CSS 2.1.</p>

<p>The UA is no longer allowed to select an aribtrary minimum width.</p>

<p>The used width of replaced elements with an intrinsic ratio and both
'width' and 'height' specified as 'auto' is now calculated according to
a table designed to preserve the intrinsic ratio as much as possible
within the given constraints.</p>

<h3 id="c10.5"><a href="visudet.html#the-height-property">Section 10.5
Content height</a></h3>

<p>Removed mention of 'line-height' for inline elements since their
content box height no longer depends on 'line-height'.</p>

<p>Percentage heights on absolutely-positioned elements are no longer
treated as 'auto' when the containing block's height is not explicitly
specified. Added a note to explain why this is possible.</p>

<p>Specified that a percentage height on the root element is relative
to the initial containing block.</p>

<h3 id="c10.6"><a href="visudet.html#Computing_heights_and_margins">Section 10.6
Calculating heights and margins</a></h3>

<p>The computed values of 'top' and 'bottom' for are now defined in
<a href="visuren.html#position-props">section 9.3.2</a>. The value
'auto' does not always compute to zero.</p>

<p>Added section 10.6.6 to cover cases that are no longer covered under
the previous sections.</p>

<p>Added section 10.6.7 to define 'auto' heights for block formatting
context roots. (Unlike other block boxes, the height of these boxes
increases to accomodate any normal-flow descendant floats.)</p>

<h3 id="c10.6.1"><a href="visudet.html#inline-non-replaced">Section 10.6.1
Inline, non-replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>The height of an inline box is no longer given by the 'line-height'
property and is now undefined. This section now suggests that the
height of the box can be based on the font.</p>

<h3 id="c10.6.2"><a href="visudet.html#inline-replaced-height">Section 10.6.2
Inline replaced elements, block-level replaced elements in normal flow,
'inline-block' replaced elements in normal flow and floating replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>The sizing algorithm for replaced elements now takes into account and
attempts to preserve the replaced content's intrinsic ratio. Sizing of
replaced elements with percentage intrinsic sizes and without intrinsic
sizes is now also defined.</p>

<p>Specified that for inline elements, the margin box is used when calculating
the height of the line box.</p>

<h3 id="c10.6.3"><a href="visudet.html#normal-block">Section 10.6.3
Block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow' computes
to 'visible'</a></h3>

<p>This section now only applies to elements whose 'overflow' value computes
to 'visible'; elements with other values of 'overflow' are discussed in the
new section 10.6.7 ('Auto' heights for block formatting context roots).</p>

<h3 id="c10.6.4"><a href="visudet.html#abs-non-replaced-height">Section 10.6.4
Absolutely positioned, non-replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>Defined the static position of an element more precisely.</p>

<p>Added vertical scrollbar width to the horizontal restraint equation.</p>

<p>Rewrote constraint rules.</p>

<h3 id="c10.6.5"><a href="visudet.html#abs-replaced-height">Section 10.6.5
Absolutely positioned, replaced elements</a></h3>

<p>In rule 1, applied sizing rules from section 10.6.2.</p>

<h3 id="c10.7"><a href="visudet.html#min-max-heights">Section 10.7
Minimum and maximum heights</a></h3>

<p>Percentage min/max heights on absolutely-positioned elements are no
longer treated as '0'/'none' when the containing block's height is not
explicitly specified. However if the containing block's width depends
on an element's percentage width, then the resulting layout is undefined
in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<p>The used width of replaced elements with an intrinsic ratio and both
'width' and 'height' specified as 'auto' is now calculated according to
a table designed to preserve the intrinsic ratio as much as possible
within the given constraints.</p>

<h3 id="c10.8"><a href="visudet.html#line-height">Section 10.8
Line height calculations</a></h3>

<p>Added rule 4 to specify that the height of the line box must be at
least as much as that specified by the 'line-height' property on the
this block.</p>

<h3 id="c10.8.1"><a href="visudet.html#q26">Section 10.8.1
Leading and half-leading</a></h3>

<p>UAs are no longer permitted to clip content to the line box, and
are instead asked to render overlapping boxes in document order.</p>

<p>'line-height' set on a block no longer specifies the minimal height
of each inline box; instead it specifies the minimal height of each
line box. The exact effect of this requirement is expressed in terms
of struts; it is affected by vertical-alignment.</p>

<p>Adjusted text to reflect that the content box height of an inline
is no longer dictated by the 'line-height' property.</p>

<p>Since the content box is now defined by the font and not by the
line-height, 'text-top' and 'text-bottom' refer to the content area
instead of the font.</p>

<p>Defined 'top' and 'bottom' alignment in terms of aligned subtrees
to take into account any protruding descendants.</p>

<p>Defined the baseline of inline tables and inline blocks.</p>

<h3 id="c11.1"><a href="visufx.html#overflow-clipping">Section 11.1
Overflow and clipping</a></h3>

<p>Specified that 'overflow' clips to the padding edge.</p>

<h3 id="c11.1.1"><a href="visufx.html#overflow">Section 11.1.1
Overflow</a></h3>

<p>'projection' media are no longer permitted to print overflowing
content for 'overflow: scroll'. 'print' media now <em>may</em>, as
opposed to <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>UAs are now required to apply the 'overflow' property set on the root
element to the viewport. Additionally, HTML UAs must use the 'overflow'
property on the HTML BODY element instead if the root element's
'overflow' value is 'visible'.</p>

<p>Specified placement of scrollbar in the box model.</p>

<h3 id="c11.1.2"><a href="visufx.html#clipping">Section 11.1.2 Clipping:
the 'clip' property</a></h3>

<p>The 'clip' property now applies only to absolutely positioned elements.
Furthermore, it applies to those elements even when their 'overflow' is
'visible'.</p>

<p>The default value of 'clip', 'auto', now indiciates no clipping
rather than clipping to the element's border box.</p>

<p>Values of "rect()" should be separated by commas. UAs are
required to support this syntax, but may also support a space-separated
syntax since CSS2 was not clear about this.</p>

<p>While CSS2 specified that values of "rect()" give offsets from the
respective sides of the box, current implementations interpret values
with respect to the top and left edges for <em>all</em> four values
(top, right, bottom, and left). This is now the specified
interpretation.

<h3 id="c11.2"><a href="visufx.html#visibility">Section 11.2
Visibility</a></h3>

<p>The 'visibility' property is now defined to inherit, and descendant
elements can override an ancestor's hidden visibility.</p>

<h3 id="c12"><a href="generate.html">Chapter 12
Generated content, automatic numbering, and lists</a></h3>

<p>Moved all discussion of aural rendering to Appendix A.</p>

<h3 id="c12.1"><a href="generate.html#before-after-content">Section 12.1
The :before and :after pseudo-elements</a></h3>

<p>Removed restrictions on which properties and property values
are allowed on ':before' and ':after' pseudo-elements.</p>

<h3 id="c12.2"><a href="generate.html#content">Section 12.2 The
'content' property</a></h3>

<p>The initial value of 'content' is now 'normal', not the empty
string.</p>

<p>The 'content' property now distinguishes between the empty string,
which creates an empty box; and 'normal'/'none', which create no box
at all. (There is no distinction between 'normal' and 'none' in
level&nbsp;2.)</p>

<p>A UA is now allowed to report a URI that fails to download.</p>

<p>Removed recommendation to authors to put rules with media-sensitive
'content' properties inside '@media'.</p>

<p>Whether '\A' escapes in generated content create line breaks is now
subject to the 'white-space' property.</p>

<p>The former section 12.3 on interaction between ':before', ':after'
and elements with 'display: compact' or 'display: run-in' has been
removed. (The interaction is already fully defined, because generated
content consists of boxes in the tree, no different from other boxes.)

<h3 id="c12.3.2"><a href="generate.html#quotes-insert">Section 12.3.2
Inserting quotes with the 'content' property</a></h3>

<p>Specified that extra 'close-quote's and 'no-close-quote's (those
without a matching 'open-quote' or 'no-open-quote') are not rendered,
and that neither 'close-quote' nor 'no-close-quote' cause the quoting
depth to be negative.</p>

<h3 id="c12.4"><a href="generate.html#counters">Section 12.4 Automatic
counters and numbering</a></h3>

<p>Defined what a rule with duplicate counters, such as
'counter-reset: section 2 section', means.</p>

<h3 id="c12.4.1"><a href="generate.html#scope">Section 12.4.1 Nested
counters and scope</a></h3>

<p>The scope of a counter no longer defaults to the whole document,
but starts at the first element that uses the counter. (This affects
counters that are used without a prior 'counter-reset' to set the
scope explicitly.)</p>

<h3 id="c12.5"><a href="generate.html#q10">Section 12.5
Lists</a></h3>

<p>Removed text in section 12.5 (formerly 12.6) relating to the
'marker' display value.</p>

<p>Removed the 'marker-offset' property (and thus former section 12.6.1).</p>

<h3 id="c12.5.1"><a href="generate.html#lists">Section 12.5.1
Lists</a></h3>

<p>The list styles 'hebrew', 'armenian', 'georgian', 'cjk-ideographs',
'hiragana', 'katakana', 'hiragana-iroha' and 'katakana-iroha' have
been removed due to lack of implementation experience. (They are
expected to return in the CSS3 Lists module.)</p>

<p>Removed the sentence that said that an unknown value for
'list-style-type' should cause the value 'decimal' to be used instead. 
Instead, normal parsing rules apply and cause the rule to be
ignored.</p>

<h3 id="c13.1"><a href="page.html">Chapter 13 Paged media</a></h3>

<p>The 'size', 'marks', and 'page' properties are not part of
CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c13.2.2"><a href="page.html#q6">Section 13.2.2
Page selectors</a></h3>

<p>The requirement for UA's to honor different declarations for
:left, :right, and :first pages has been softened to simplify
implementations: the page area of the :first page may be used
for :left and :right pages as well.</p>

<h3 id="c13.3.1"><a href="page.html#page-break-props">Section 13.3.1
Page break properties</a></h3>

<p>UAs are now only required to apply the page break properties
to block-level elements in the normal flow of the root element,
not to other blocks.However, UAs are now permitted to apply these
properties to elements other than block-level elements.</p>

<p>Defined treatment of margins, borders, and padding when a page
break splits a box.</p>

<h3 id="c13.3.3"><a href="page.html#allowed-page-breaks">Section 13.3.3
Allowed page breaks</a></h3>

<p>When dropping restrictions to find a page breaking opportunity,
rule A is dropped together with B and D rather than together with C.</p>

<p>Removed restriction on breaking within absolutely positioned boxes.</p>

<h3 id="c14.2.1"><a href="colors.html#background-properties">Section
14.2.1 Background properties</a></h3>

<p>For 'background-position', the restriction that keywords cannot
be combined with percentage or length values is removed. I.e., a
value like: '25% top' is now allowed. Also, 'background-position'
now applies to all elements, not just to block-level and replaced
elements.</p>

<p>User agents are no longer allowed to treat a value of 'fixed'
for 'background-attachment' as 'scroll'. Instead they must ignore
all such declarations as if 'fixed' were an invalid value.</p>

<h3 id="c14.3"><a href="colors.html#gamma-correction">Section
14.3 Gamma correction</a></h3>

<p>The contents of this section is now a non-normative note.</p>

<h3 id="c15"><a href="fonts.html">Chapter 15 Fonts</a></h3>

<p>The 'font-stretch' and 'font-size-adjust' properties have
been removed in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<p>Font descriptors, the '@font-face' declaration, and all
associated parts of the font matching algorithm have been
removed in CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c15.2"><a href="fonts.html#algorithm">Section 15.2
Font matching algorithm</a></h3>

<p>In this section (previously 15.5), in step 5 (prevously 8)
of the font matching algorith, the UA is now allowed to use
multiple default fallback fonts to find a glyph for a given
character.</p>

<p>In the per-property rule 2, specified that if there is only
a small-caps font in a given family, then that font will be
selected by 'normal'.</p>

<h3 id="c15.3"><a href="fonts.html#font-family-prop">Section 15.2.2 Font family</a></h3>

<p>The "missing character" glyph is no longer considered a match
for the last font in a font set, but is now considered a match
for U+FFFD.</p>

<p>Certain punctuation characters when appearing in unquoted font
family names are now required to be escaped.</p>

<h3 id="c15.5"><a href="fonts.html#small-caps">Section 15.5
Small-caps</a></h3>

<p>The 'font-variant' property's effect is no longer restricted to
bicameral scripts.</p>

<h3 id="c15.6"><a href="fonts.html#font-boldness">Section 15.6
Font boldness</a></h3>

<p>The computed value of 'font-weight' has been defined more
precisely such that the 'bolder' and 'lighter' values have an
appropriate effect when inheriting through elements with
different font-families.</p>

<h3 id="c15.7"><a href="fonts.html#font-size-props">Section 15.7
Font size</a></h3>

<p>Removed suggestion of 1.2 fixed ratio between keyword font
sizes in favor of notes recommending a variable ratio and a
smallest font-size no less than 9 pixels per EM unit.</p>

<p>Added table mapping CSS font-size keywords to HTML font size numbers.</p>

<h3 id="c16"><a href="text.html">Chapter 16 Text</a></h3>

<p>The 'text-shadow' property is not in CSS&nbsp;2.1.

<h3 id="c16.2"><a href="text.html#alignment-prop">Section 16.2
Alignment</a></h3>

<p>The initial value of 'text-align' is no longer UA-defined but
a nameless value that acts as 'left' if 'direction' is 'ltr',
'right' if 'direction' is 'rtl'.</p>

<p>The &lt;string&gt; value for 'text-align' is not part of
CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<p>For 'text-align', specified that 'justify' is treated as the initial
value when computed value of 'white-space' is 'pre' or 'pre-line'.</p>

<h3 id="c16.3.1"><a href="text.html#lining-striking-props">Section 16.3.1
Underlining, over lining, striking, and blinking</a></h3>

<p>More precisely defined what boxes are affected by text decorations
specified on a given element.</p>

<p>Specified that underlines, overlines, and line-throughs apply ony to
text.</p>

<p>Specified that an underline, overline, or line-through applied across
a line must be at a constant vertical position and with a constant
thickness across the entire line.</p>

<p>Specified how text decorations are affected by relative positioning
on descendants.</p>

<p>User agents are now allowed to recognize the 'blink' value but not
blink, whereas before they were required to ignore the 'blink' value
if they chose not to support blinking text.</p>

<p>Added text to allow older UAs to conform to this section if they
follow CSS2's 'text-decoration' requirements but not the additional
requirements in CSS2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c16.4"><a href="text.html#spacing-props">Section 16.4
Letter and word spacing</a></h3>

<p>Support for the various values of 'letter-spacing' and 'word-spacing'
is no longer optional.</p>

<p>Specified that word spacing affects each space, non-breaking space,
and ideographic space left in the text after white space processing
rules have been applied.</p>

<h3 id="c16.5"><a href="text.html#caps-prop">Section 16.5
Capitalization</a></h3>

<p>UAs are no longer allowed to not transform characters for which there
is an appropriate transformation but which are outside of Latin-1.</p>

<h3 id="c16.6"><a href="text.html#white-space-prop">Section 16.6
Whitespace</a></h3>

<p>The 'white-space' property now applies to all elements, not just
to block-level elements.</p>

<p>"\A" in generated content no longer forces a break for 'normal'
and 'nowrap' values of 'white-space'.</p>

<p>Specified that the CSS white space processing model assumes all
newlines have been normalized to line feeds.</p>

<p>Added <a href="text.html#q8">section 16.6.1</a> to precisely define
white space handling.</p>

<p>Added <a href="text.html#q10">section 16.6.3</a> to specify handling
of control and combining characters.</p>

<h3 id="c17"><a href="tables.html">Chapter 17
Tables</a></h3>

<p>Moved all discussion of aural rendering and related properties
to Appendix A.</p>

<p>Updated prose to use the terms "specified", "computed" and "used"
as appropriate when referencing values. (See <a href="#c6.1">changes
to section 6.1</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="c17.2"><a href="tables.html#q2">17.2 The CSS table model</a></h3>

<p>Defined handling of multiple 'table-header-group' and 'table-footer-group'
elements.</p>

<p>UAs are no longer allowed to ignore the table display values
on arbitrary HTML elements, only on HTML table elements.</p>

<h3 id="c17.2.1"><a href="tables.html#anonymous-boxes">Section 17.2.1
Anonymous table objects</a></h3>

<p>Changed rules so that internal table elements without an enclosing
'table' or 'inline-table' box generate an anonymous 'inline-table'
rather than an anonymous 'table' when inside a "display: inline"
parent element.</p>

<p>The anonymous table object rules now treat anonymous boxes as equal
to elements' boxes. Replaced several instances of the term "element" with
"box", removed several instances of "(in the document tree)" and clarified
that anonymous boxes generated in earlier rules are part of the input to
later rules. Also replaced the term "object" with "box", as is used
throughout the rest of the specification.</p>

<p>HTML UAs are no longer exempt from the anonymous box generation rules.</p>

<h3 id="c17.4"><a href="tables.html#q5">Section 17.4
Tables in the visual formatting model</a></h3>

<p>The relationship of the caption box, table box, and outer anonymous
table box has been changed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The margins of the table box now apply to the outer (anonymous)
    table box that encloses both the table box and the caption(s),
    not to the inner table box.</li>
  <li>The width of the anonymous box is now equal to the border-box
    width of the table box inside it instead of adapting to the widths
    and positions of both the table box and its captions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="c17.4.1"><a href="tables.html#q6">Section 17.4.1
Caption position and alignment</a></h3>

<p>The 'left' and 'right' values on 'caption-side' have been removed.</p>

<h3 id="c17.5"><a href="tables.html#q7">Section 17.5
Visual layout of table contents</a></h3>

<p>Changed rule 5 in grid layout rules to allow overlapping of
table cells instead of leaving skipping a gap in the grid to
avoid overlap.</p>

<h3 id="c17.5.1"><a href="tables.html#table-layers">Section 17.5.1
Table layers and transparency</a></h3>

<p>In point 6, changed 'These "empty" cells are transparent' to:

<blockquote>
<p>If the value of their 'empty-cells' property is 'hide'
these "empty" cells are transparent through the cell, row, row group,
column, and column group backgrounds, letting the table background
show through.</blockquote>

<h3 id="c17.5.2.1"><a href="tables.html#fixed-table-layout">Section 17.5.2.1
Fixed table layout</a></h3>

<p>Specified that in fixed table layout, extra columns in rows
after the first must not be rendered.</p>

<h3 id="c17.5.2.2"><a href="tables.html#auto-table-layout">Section 17.5.2.2
Automatic table layout</a></h3>

<p>Restricted inputs to the table layout algorithm for 'table-layout: auto',
whether or not the algorithm described in this section is used, to the
width of the containing block and the content of, and any CSS properties
set on, the table and any of its descendants.</p>

<p>Added rule 4 to include the column group's width in the algorithm
for determining column widths.</p>

<h3 id="c17.5.3"><a href="tables.html#height-layout">Section 17.5.3
Table height algorithms</a></h3>

<p>The 'height' property on tables is now treated as a mininimum
height; the UA no longer has the option of using 'height' to
constrain the size of the table to be smaller than its contents.</p>

<p>Percentage heights on table cells, rows, and row groups now
compute to 'auto'.</p>

<p>The baseline of a cell is now defined much more precisely.</p>

<p>Defined the baseline of a row with no baseline-aligned cells.</p>

<h3 id="c17.5.4"><a href="tables.html#column-alignment">17.5.4
Horizontal alignment in a column</a></h3>

<p>The &lt;string&gt; value for 'text-align' is not part of
CSS&nbsp;2.1.</p>

<h3 id="c17.6"><a href="tables.html#borders">Section 17.6
Borders</a></h3>

<p>Several popular browsers assume an initial value for
'border-collapse' of 'separate' rather than 'collapse' or exhibit
behavior that is close to that value, even if they do not actually
implement the CSS table model. 'Separate' is now the initial value.</p>

<h3 id="c17.6.1"><a href="tables.html#separated-borders">Section 17.6.1
The separated borders model</a></h3>

<p>Specified the effect of padding on the table element.</p>

<p>Specified which parts of the table are included in the width
measurement.</p>

<h3 id="c17.6.1.1"><a href="tables.html#empty-cells">Section 17.6.1.1
Borders and Backgrounds around empty cells</a></h3>

<p>Refined definition of "empty" when used as a condition for the
'empty-cells' property so that it is not triggered when the cell
includes any child elements, even if they are empty.</p>

<p>The 'empty-cells' property now hides both borders and backgrounds,
not just borders.</p>

<p>Changed behavior of a row when it collapses due to 'empty-cells':
it is no longer treated as "display: none". Instead it is given zero
height and its associated border-spacing is eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="c17.6.2"><a href="tables.html#collapsing-borders">Section 17.6.2
The collapsing border model</a></h3>

<p>The outer half of the table borders no longer lie in the margin area.
Specified which part of the table is considered the border are
in the collapsed borders model and how its width is calculated.
The edges of the box in which the table background is painted
is, however left explicitly undefined.</p>

<h3 id="c17.6.2.1"><a href="tables.html#border-conflict-resolution">Section 17.6.2.1
Border conflict resolution</a></h3>

<p>Defined in rule 4 what happens when two elements of the same
type conflict and their borders have the same width and style.</p>

<h3 id="c18.4"><a href="ui.html#dynamic-outlines">Section 18.4
Dynamic outlines</a></h3>

<p>Position of outline with respect to the border edge is now
only suggested, not required.</p>

<p>Conformant UAs are now allowed to ignore the 'invert' value.
In such UAs the initial value of 'outline-color' is the value of
the 'color' property.</p>

<h3 id="s-12"><a href="generate.html">Chapter 12 Generated content,
automatic numbering, and lists</a></h3>

<p>The 'marker' value for 'display' does not exist in CSS&nbsp;2.1



<h3 id="cA"><a href="aural.html">Appendix A. Aural style
sheets</a></h3>

<p>Chapter 19 on aural style sheets has become appendix A and is not
normative in CSS&nbsp;2.1. Related units (deg, grad, rad, ms, s, Hz,
kHz) are also moved to this appendix, as is the 'speak-header'
property from the "tables" chapter and other notes on aural table
rendering. The 'aural' media type is deprecated in favor of the new
'speech' media type.</p>

<h3 id="cA.5"><a href="aural.html#pause-props">Appendix A Section 5 Pause properties</a></h3>

<p>Changed the initial value of 'pause-before' and 'pause-after' to
be 0 instead of UA-defined.</p>

<p>A note has been added to this section (formerly 19.4) about the change
in position and behavior of pauses in CSS3 Speech compared to this appendix.</p>

<h3 id="cA.6"><a href="aural.html#cue-props">Appendix A Section 6 Cue properties</a></h3>

<p>This section (formerly Section 19.5) now specifies the placement
of cues and pauses with respect to the :before and :after pseudo-elements.</p>

<p>Various references in Appendix B (formerly Appendix E) have been
updated as appropriate.</p>

<p>Switched [CSS1] from Normative to Informative.</p>

<p>Updated URI reference from [RFC1808] and the draft-fielding-uri-syntax-01.txt

<p>Updated HTTP reference from [RFC2068] to [RFC2616].</p>

<p>Removed normative references to [IANA] and [ICC32].<p>

<p>Added normative references to [ICC42], [RFC3986], [RFC2070], [UAAG10].</p>

<p>Added informative references to CSS2, CSS3 Color, CSS3 Lists,

<h2><a name="known-errors">Errors</a></h2>

<h3 id="x-shorthand-inherit">Shorthand properties</h3>

<p>Shorthand properties take a list of subproperty values <em>or</em>
the value 'inherit'. One cannot mix 'inherit' with other subproperty
values as it would not be possible to specify the subproperty to which
'inherit' applied. The definitions of a number of shorthand properties
did not enforce this rule: 'border-top', 'border-right',
'border-bottom', 'border-left', 'border', 'background', 'font',
'list-style', 'cue', and 'outline'.

<h3 id="x-applies-table">Applies to</h3>

<p>The "applies to" line of many property definitions has been made more
accurate by excluding or including table display types where appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="x4.1.1"><a href="syndata.html#tokenization">Section 4.1.1</a> (and
<a href="grammar.html#q2">G2</a>)</h3>

<p>DELIM should not have included single or double quote. Refer also

double quotes around them.

<ul>
<li>The "nmchar" token also allows the range "A-Z".
<li>In the rule for "any" (in the core syntax), changed "FUNCTION"

</ul>

<p id="underscore">The underscore character

macros "nmstart" and "nmchar" now include it.

<h3 id="x4.1.3"><a href="syndata.html#q4">4.1.3 Characters and case</a></h3>

<p>In the third bullet, added to point 1:

<blockquote>
<p>1.with a space (or other whitespace character): "\26 B" ("&amp;B") 
</blockquote>

<p>the following text: "In this case, user agents should treat a
"CR/LF" pair (13/10) as a single whitespace character."

<p>The underscore is
allowed in identifiers. Changed "In CSS2, identifiers [...] can contain
only the characters [A-Za-z0-9] and ISO 10646 characters 161 and
higher, plus the hyphen (-)" to:

<blockquote><p>In CSS2, identifiers [...] contain only the characters

<h3 id="x4.3"><a href="syndata.html#values">Section 4.3 (Double sign problem)</a></h3>

<p>Several values described in subsections of this section
incorrectly allowed two "+" or "-" signs at their beginnings. 

<h3 id="x4.3.2"><a href="syndata.html#length-units">Section 4.3.2
Lengths</a></h3>

<p>The suggested reference
pixel is based on a <ins>96&nbsp;dpi</ins> device, not 90&nbsp;dpi.
The visual angle is thus about <ins>0.0213 degrees</ins> instead of
0.0227, and a pixel at arm's length is about <ins>0.26&nbsp;mm</ins>
instead of 0.28

<h3 id="x4.3.6"><a href="syndata.html#color-units">Section 4.3.6</a></h3>

<p>Deleted the comments about range

</pre>

<h3 id="x5.10"><a href="selector.html#q2">Section 5.10
Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes</a></h3>

<p>In the second bullet, added that the ':lang()' pseudo-class can also
be deduced from the document in some cases.</p>

<h3 id="x6.4"><a href="cascade.html#cascade">Section 6.4 The cascade</a></h3>

<p>Removed paragraph about imported style sheets being overridden by

<h3 id="x8.1"><a href="box.html#box-dimensions">Section 8.1 Box Dimensions</a></h3>

<p>The definition of "content edge" has been changed to depend on 'width'
and 'height' rather than directly on 'rendered content'.</p>

<p>From the definition of "padding edge", deleted the sentence "The
padding edge of a box defines the edges of the containing block
established by the box." For information about containing
blocks, consult <a href="visudet.html#containing-block-details">
Section 10.1</a>.</p>

<h3 id="x8.2"><a href="box.html#mpb-examples">8.2 Example of margins, padding, and borders</a></h3>

<p>The colors in the example HTML did not match the colors in the
image.

<h3 id="x8.5.4"><a
href="box.html#border-shorthand-properties">Section 8.5.4
Border shorthand properties</a></h3>

<p>Changedvarious border shorthands' syntax definitions to use the
&lt;border-width&gt;, &lt;border-style&gt; and &lt;'border-top-color'&gt;
value types as appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="x9.2.1"><a href="visuren.html#containing-block">Section 9.2.1
Block-level elements and block boxes</a></h3>

<p>Excepted table elements from second paragraph about principal block
boxes and their contents.</p>

<p>Corrected sentence to say "either only block boxes or only inline
boxes" instead of "only block boxes".</p>

<h3 id="x9.3.1"><a href="visuren.html#choose-position">Section 9.3.1
Choosing a positioning scheme</a></h3>

<p>In the definition of "position: static", added 'right' and 'bottom'
to the sentence saying that 'top' and 'left' do not apply.</p>

<h3 id="x9.3.2"><a href="visuren.html#position-props">Section 9.3.2
Box offsets</a></h3>

<p>The properties 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left', incorrectly
referred to offsets with respect to a box's content edge. The proper edge
is the margin edge. Thus, for 'top', the description now reads:
"This property specifies how far a box's top margin edge is offset
below the top edge of the box's containing block."

<p>Corrected text under property definitions to say that for
relatively-positioned elements, 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left'
define the offset from the box's position in the normal flow, not
from the edges of the containing block. (The previous definition
conflicted with that was further down; since that text is now
redundant, it has been removed.)</p>

<h3 id="x9.4.1"><a href="visuren.html#block-formatting">Section 9.4.1
Block formatting contexts</a></h3>

<p>In paragraph about relationship of a box's outer edges to its
containing block's edges, corrected parenthetical to say that
<em>line boxes</em>, not the <em>content area</em>, may shrink due
to floats.</p>

<h3 id="x9.4.2"><a href="visuren.html#inline-formatting">Section 9.4.2
Inline formatting context</a></h3>

<p>Added "and the presence of floats" to "The width of a line box is
determined by a containing block".</p>

<h3 id="x9.4.3"><a href="visuren.html#relative-positioning">Section 9.4.3
Relative positioning</a></h3>

<p>In the first paragraph, added "or floated" to the phrase "laid out
according to the normal flow" as floated elements can be relatively
positioned but are not part of the normal flow.</p>

<h3 id="x9.5"><a href="visuren.html#floats">Section 9.5
Floats</a></h3>

<p>Corrected sentence about not enough horizontal room for the float
to say that it is shifted downward until either it fits <em>or there
are no more floats present</em>.</p>

<h3 id="x9.5.1"><a href="visuren.html#float-position">Section 9.5.1
Positioning the float</a></h3>

<p>Correct "Applies to" line and prose to say that the 'float' property
can be set for any element but only applies to elements that are not
absolutely positioned.</p>

<h3 id="x9.5.2"><a href="visuren.html#flow-control">Section 9.5.2
Controlling flow next to floats</a></h3>

<p>Removed sentence saying that 'clear' may only be specified for
block-level elements: it can be specified for any element, it only
<em>applies to</em> block-level elements.</p>

<h3 id="x9.6"><a href="visuren.html#absolute-positioning">Section 9.6
Absolute positioning</a></h3>

<p>Corrected sentence that said absolutely positioned boxes establish
a new containing block for absolutely positioned descendants to
except fixed positioned descendants.</p>

<h3 id="x9.7"><a href="visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">Section 9.7
Relationships between 'display', 'position', and 'float'</a></h3>

<p>In rule 1, corrected "user agents must ignore 'position' and 'float"
to "'position' and 'float' do not apply".</p>

<h3 id="x9.10"><a href="visuren.html#direction">Section 9.10
Text direction</a></h3>

<p>Corrected note about 'direction' on table column elements to say
that "columns are not the ancestors of the cells in the document tree"
rather than saying "columns don't exist in the document tree".</p>

<p>Added table cells, table captions, and inline blocks alongside
block-level elements in description of 'bidi-override' value. Also
corrected the prose to handle anonymous child blocks.</p>

<p>Updated mention of Unicode's embedding limit from 15 to 61.</p>

<h3 id="x10.1"><a href="visudet.html#containing-block-details">Section 10.1
Definition of "containing block"</a></h3>

<p>Included table cells (and inline blocks) together with block-level elements
in rule 2 defining the containing block of non-absolutely-positioned elements.</p>


<h3 id="x10.3.3"><a href="visudet.html#blockwidth">Section 10.3.3</a></h3>

<p>In the last sentence of the paragraph following the equation
("If the value of 'direction' is 'ltr', this happens to 
'margin-left' instead") substituted 'rtl' for 'ltr'.</p>

<h3 id="x10.4"><a href="visudet.html#min-max-widths">Section 10.4
Minimum and maximum widths</a></h3>

<p>The initial value for 'min-width' is now '0' rather than UA-dependent.</p>

<p>Corrected "applies to" exception for both 'min-width' and 'max-width'
from "table elements" to "table rows and row groups".</p>

<p>Specified that negative values for 'min-width' and 'max-width' are
illegal.</p>

<h3 id="x10.6.3"><a href="visudet.html#normal-block">Section 10.6.3
Block-level non-replaced elements in normal flow when 'overflow'
computes to 'visible'</a></h3>

<p>Added that 'auto' height also depends on whether the element has
padding or borders, as these influence margin-collapsing behavior.</p>

<p>Added text to correctly account for margin collapsing behavior.</p>

<h3 id="x10.7"><a href="visudet.html#min-max-heights">Section 10.7
Minimum and maximum heights</a></h3>

<p>Corrected "applies to" exception for both 'min-width' and 'max-width'
from "table elements" to "table columns and column groups".</p>

<p>Specified that negative values for 'min-height' and 'max-height'
are illegal.</p>

<h3 id="x11.1.1"><a href="visufx.html#overflow">Section 11.1.1
Overflow</a></h3>

<p>Corrected "applies to" line for 'overflow' from "block-level and
replaced elements" to "non-replaced block-level elements, table cells,
and inline-block elements".</p>

<p>The example of a DIV element containing a BLOCKQUOTE containing
another DIV was not rendered correctly. The first style rule applied
to both DIVs, so the second DIV box should have been rendered with a
red border as well. The second DIV has now been changed to a CITE,
which doesn't have a red border.

<h3 id="x11.1.2"><a href="visufx.html#clipping">Section 11.1.2 Clipping:
the 'clip' property</a></h3>

<p>Corrected "rect (&lt;top&gt; &lt;right&gt; &lt;bottom&gt; &lt;left&gt;)" to
"rect(&lt;top&gt;, &lt;right&gt;, &lt;bottom&gt;, &lt;left&gt;)".</p>

<h3 id="x11.2"><a href="visufx.html#overflow-clipping ">Section 11.2
Visibility</a></h3>

<p>Corrected initial value of 'visibility' to 'visible'.</p>

<h3 id="x12.6.2"><a href="generate.html#lists">12.6.2 Lists</a></h3>

<p>Under the 'list-style' property, the example:</p>

<pre>
ul > ul { list-style: circle outside } /* Any UL child of a UL */
</pre>

<p>could never match valid HTML markup (since a UL element
cannot be a child of another UL element). An LI has been inserted in
between.

<h3 id="x14.2"><a href="colors.html#q2">14.2 The background</a></h3>

<p>Second sentence: "In terms of the box model, 'background' refers to
the background of the content and the padding areas" now also
mentions the border area. (See also <a href="#x60">errata to section
8.1</a> above.) Thus:

<blockquote>
<p>In terms of the box model, "background" refers to the background of
the content, padding and border areas.
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x14.2.1"><a href="colors.html#background-properties">14.2.1
Background properties</a></h3>

<p>Under 'background-image', defined the image tile size used when
the background image has intrinsic sizes specified in percentages
or no intrinsic size.</p>

<p>Under 'background-repeat',
the sentence "All tiling covers the content and padding areas [...]"
has been corrected to

<blockquote><p>"All tiling covers the content, padding <ins>and
border</ins> areas [...]".</blockquote>

<p>Under 'background-attachment', the value 'scroll' is defined to
scroll with the "containing block" rather than with the "document".
Also the sentence "Even if the image is fixed [...] background or padding
area of the element" has been corrected to

<blockquote><p>Even if the image is fixed, it is still only visible
when it is in the background, padding <ins>or border</ins> area of the
element.</blockquote>

<h3 id="x15.2"><a href="fonts.html#algorithm">Section 15.2</a></h3>

<p>In bullet 2, changed "the UA uses the 'font-family' descriptor"
to "the UA uses the 'font-family' property".

<h3 id="x15.7"><a href="fonts.html#font-size-props">Section 15.7
Font size</a></h3>

<p>The statement "Negative values are not allowed" for 'font-size'
now applies to percentages as well as lengths.</p>

<h3 id="x16.1"><a href="text.html#indentation-prop">Section 16.1
Indentation</a></h3>

<p>Corrected 'text-indent' to apply to table cells (and inline blocks)
as well as block-level elements.</p>

<h3 id="x16.2"><a href="text.html#alignment-prop">Section 16.2
Alignment</a></h3>

<p>Corrected 'text-align' to apply to table cells (and inline blocks)
as well as block-level elements.

<p>Changed prose about the effect of 'justify' to be less correct.</p>

<p>Corrected the note to say that justification is also dependent
on the script, not just the language, of the text.</p>

<h3 id="x17.2"><a href="tables.html#q2">Section 17.2 The CSS table
model</a></h3>

<p>In the definition of <strong>table-header-group</strong>, changed
"footer" to "header" in "Print user agents may repeat footer rows on
each page spanned by a table."

<h3 id="x17.2.1"><a href="tables.html#anonymous-boxes">Section 17.2.1
Anonymous table objects </a></h3>

<p>Added 'table-header-group' and 'table-footer-group' alongside
mentions of 'table-row-group' where missing.</p>

<p>Corrected 'caption' to 'table-caption'.</p>

<p>Added missing rule (#3) for 'table-column' boxes.</p>

<p>Added 'table-caption' and 'table-column-group' to list of boxes
requiring a 'table' or 'inline-table' parent in rule 4.</p>

<p>Added rules 5 and 6 to generate 'table-row' boxes where necessary
for children of 'table'/'inline-table' and
'table-row-group'/'table-header-group'/'table-footer-group' boxes.</p>

<h3 id="x17.4"><a href="tables.html#q5">Section 17.4
Tables in the visual formatting model</a></h3>

<p>Specified handling of multiple caption boxes.</p>

<p>Specified that the anonymous outer table box is a 'block'
box if the table is block-level and an 'inline-block' box if
the table is inline-level but that the anonymous outer table
box cannot accept run-ins.</p>

<h3 id="x17.5"><a href="tables.html#q7">Section 17.5
Visual layout of table contents</a></h3>

<p>Correct text that said all internal table elements have
padding; change to say that of these only table cells have
padding.</p>

<p>The following note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Table cells may be relatively and absolutely positioned, but this is not recommended: positioning and floating remove a
    box from the flow, affecting table alignment. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>has been amended as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Table cells may be 
positioned, but this is not recommended: absolute and fixed
positioning, as well as floating, remove a box from the flow, affecting
table size.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="x17.5.1"><a href="tables.html#table-layers">Section 17.5.1
Table layers and transparency</a></h3>

<p>The rows and columns only cover the whole table in the collapsed
borders model, not in the separated borders model.

<p>The points 2, 3, 4 and 5 have been corrected to define the area
covered by rows, columns, row groups and column groups and thus the
positioning and painting of backgrounds on those elements.</p>

<p>Specify the handling of "missing cells".</p>

<h3 id="x17.6.1"><a href="tables.html#separated-borders">Section 17.6.1

<p>For the 'ButtonHighlight' value, changed the description
from "Dark shadow" to "Highlight color".</p>


<h3 id="underscore2"><a href="grammar.html#q2">Appendix D.2 Lexical
scanner</a></h3>

<p>The underscore character
("_") is be allowed in identifiers. The definitions of the lexical
macros "nmstart" and "nmchar" have been fixed.

<p>Note that the tokenizer is case-insensitive, so uppercase A-Z is
matched as well.

<p>(Same change in section 4.1.1, see <a href="#underscore">above</a>.)

<h3 id="r3.1"><a href="conform.html#defs">Definitions</a></h3>

<p>Added a note to clarify that the deprecated/non-deprecated status

<p>Under 'document language' clarified that CSS only describes the
presentation of a document language, and has no effect on its semantics.</p>

<p>Changed definition of 'replaced element' to "an element whose content

text. This clarifies that e.g. SVG images embedded in an XML document are
also considered replaced elements, not just those linked in from an outside
file. Also changed definition of 'rendered content' to be consistent with this
clarification.</p>

<p>Added definition for 'ignore'.</p>

<p>Split "aural" media group into "audio" and "speech".</p>

<h3 id="r8.1"><a href="box.html#box-dimensions">Section 8.1 Box dimensions</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>The terms "content box", "padding box", "border box", and "margin box"
have been defined.
<li>Border backgrounds are not specified by border properties. Changed
the last paragraph of 8.1 to:
<blockquote>
<p>The background style of the content, padding, and border areas of a
box is specified by the <span

</blockquote>
<li>Removed definition of "box width" and "height".
</ul>

<h3 id="r8.3"><a href="box.html#margin-properties">Section 8.3 Margin properties</a></h3>

<h3 id="r8.3.1"><a href="box.html#collapsing-margins">Section 8.3.1</a></h3>

<p>Changed "absolute maximum" to "maximum of the absolute values" in
sentence about negative margins collapsing.</p>

<p>Added this clarifying note to the first bullet of the explanation
of vertical collapsing of margins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> Adjoining boxes may be generated by
elements that are not related as siblings or ancestors.
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasized that floating elements' margins do not collapse even between a float
and its in-flow children.</p>

<p>Emphasized that absolutely positioned elements' margins do not collapse even between
the positioned element and its in-flow children.</p>

<h3 id="r8.5.3"><a href="box.html#border-style-properties">Section 8.5.3

The viewport</a></h3>

<p>Changed the sentence "When the viewport is smaller than the ..., the user

block".</p>

<h3 id="r9.3.1"><a href="visuren.html#choose-position">Section 9.3.1

<h3 id="r9.3.2"><a href="visuren.html#position-props">Section 9.3.2
Box offsets</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that negative lengths and percentages are allowed as values
of 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left'.</p>

<p>Added "For replaced elements, the effect of this value depends only
on the intrinsic dimensions of the replaced content. See the sections
on the width and height of absolutely positioned, replaced elements
for details." to the definition of 'auto' because that's not what
chapter 10 says at all.</p>

<h3 id="r9.4.2"><a href="visuren.html#inline-formatting">Section 9.4.2
Inline formatting context</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that 'justify' stretches "spaces and words in inline boxes";
previous text simply said that it stretches "inline boxes".</p>

<p>The statement "When an inline box is split, margins, borders, and
padding have no visual effect where the split occurs." has been
generalized. Margins, borders, and padding have no visual effect
where one or more splits occur.</p>

<p>Clarified that an inline box that exceeds the width of a line box
and cannot be split therefore overflows the line box.</p>

<p>Removed sentence about formatting of margins, borders, and padding
for split inline boxes not being fully defined when affected by bidi
as that situation is now defined in <a href="box.html#q11">section
8.6</a>.</p>

<h3 id="r9.4.3"><a href="visuren.html#relative-positioning">Section 9.4.3
Relative positioning</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that although relative positioning normally doesn't
directly affect layout, it may affect layout indirectly through
the creation of scrollbars.</p>

<p>Relatively positioned boxes do not always establish new containing
blocks. Changed the second paragraph to refer to the section on
containing blocks accordingly.</p>

<p>The paragraph about dynamic movement and superscripting has been
shifted into a non-normative note.</p>

<h3 id="r9.5"><a href="visuren.html#floats">Section 9.5

<p>Clarified that line boxes are shortened to make room for the

<p>Added some text to clarify what "Any content in the current line before
a floated box is reflowed in the first available line on the other side of
the float" means.</p>

<p>Clarified floats' position in the stacking order.</p>

<h3 id="r9.5.1"><a href="visuren.html#float-position">Section 9.5.1

<p>Added a note to clarify that the images in this section are not
drawn to scale and are illustrations, not reference renderings.</p>

<h3 id="r10.1"><a href="visudet.html#contianing-block-details">Section 10.1

<p>Noted that a containing block formed by inline elements may wind up
with a negative containing block width.</p>

<h3 id="r10.2"><a href="visudet.html#the-width-property">Section 10.2
Content width</a></h3>

<p>In the definition of &lt;length&gt; values for the 'width' property,

<h3 id="r10.3.3"><a href="visudet.html#blockwidth">Section 10.3.3
Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow</a></h3>

horizontally centers the element within its containing block.</p>

<h3 id="r10.4"><a href="visudet.html#min-max-widths">Section 10.4
Minimum and maximum widths</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that 'min-width' and 'max-width' do not affect the

<h3 id="r10.8"><a href="visudet.html#line-height">Section 10.8
Line height calculations</a></h3>

<p>Removed clarifying note about line height being taller than tallest
single inline box due to vertical alignment.</p>

<h3 id="r11.1"><a href="visufx.html#overflow-clipping">Section 11.1
Overflow and clipping</a></h3>

<p>Clarified when absolute positioning and negative margins cause
overflow.</p>

<p>Added 'text-indent' to the list of things that can cause overflow.</p>

<p>Removed mention of 'clip' since it no longer affects most elements;
mentioned that the 'overflow' property also specifies whether a
scrolling mechanism is provided to access clipped content.</p>

<h3 id="r11.1.1"><a href="visufx.html#overflow">Section 11.1.1
Overflow</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that descendant elements whose containing block is the
viewport or an ancestor of the element are not affected by overflow
clipping.</p>

<p>Removed unnecessary mentions of the 'clip' property from the 'hidden'
value definition.</p>

<h3 id="r11.1.2"><a href="visufx.html#clipping">Section 11.1.2
Clipping</a></h3>

<p>Changed "portion of an element's rendered content" to "portion
of an element's border box" since clipping also affects the element's
backgrounds and borders.</p>

<p>Clarified what parts of the element are affected by clipping.</p>

<p>Clarified that clipped content does not cause overflow.</p>

<h3 id="r11.2"><a href="visufx.html#overflow-clipping ">Section 11.2
Visibility</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that descendants of a 'visibility: hidden' element will
be visible if they have 'visibility: visible'.</p>

<h3 id="r12.1"><a href="generate.html#before-after-content">Section 12.1
The :before and :after pseudo-elements</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that :before and :after pseudo-elements interact with
other boxes as if they were real elements just inside their associated
element.

<p>Noted that the interaction of :before and :after with replaced elements
is left undefined for now.</p>

<h3 id="r12.2"><a href="generate.html#content">Section 12.2
The 'content' property</a></h3>

<p>Clarified which counters are used for counter() and counters() in
case there are multiple counters of the same name.</p>

<h3 id="r12.3.2"><a href="generate.html#quotes-insert">Section 12.3.2
Inserting quotes with the 'content' property</a></h3>

<p>Removed note about common typographic practices when quotes in
different languages are mixed.</p>

<h3 id="r12.4"><a href="generate.html#counters">Section 12.4
Automatic counters and numbering</a></h3>

<p>In the "self-nesting" behavior of counters, clarified that merely
using a counter in a child element doesn't create a new instance of it:
only resetting it does.</p>

<p>Clarified that the scope of a counter does not include any elements
in the scope of a counter with the same name created by a 'counter-reset'
on a later sibling or a later 'counter-reset' on the same element.</p>

<p>Removed sentence about scope of 'counter-increment' without prior
'counter-reset' as that is now defined (differently) under
"12.4.1 Nested counters and scope."</p>

<h3 id="r12.4.3"><a href="generate.html#q9">Section 12.4.3 Counters in
elements with 'display: none'</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that pseudo-elements that generate no boxes also do not
increment counters.

<h3 id="r14.2"><a href="colors.html#q2">Section 14.2 The background</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that the root background image, although painted over the entire
canvas, is anchored as if painted only for the root element, and that the root's
background is only painted once.</p>

<p>Clarified rules for propagation of background settings on HTML's &lt;body>
element to the root.</p>

<p>Added statement about z-index of backgrounds for elements that form a
stacking context and referred to z-index property for details.</p>

<p>Added this note after the first paragraph after 'background-attachment':

<blockquote><p>Note that there is only <em>one</em> viewport per
document. I.e., even if an element has a scrolling mechanism (see
'overflow'), a 'fixed' background doesn't move with it.</blockquote>

<p>Definition of 'background-position' has been rewritten as normative rules
rather than just examples.</p>

<p>Stated that the tiling and positioning of background images for inline
elements is undefined in CSS2.1.</p>

<h3 id="r15.1"><a href="fonts.html#q1">Section 15.1 Fonts Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Drastically shortened introduction.</p>

<h3 id="r15.2"><a href="fonts.html#algorithm">Section 15.2
Font matching algorithm</a></h3>

<p>In the per-property rule 2, clarified that 'normal' matches
the non-small-caps variant (if there is one).</p>

<h3 id="r15.3"><a href="fonts.html#font-family-prop">Section 15.2.2 Font family</a></h3>

<p>Removed discussion of font-matching algorithm. (It is already
covered in the <a href="fonts.html#algorithm">font-matching algorithm's
own section</a>.</p>

<p>Clarified that quoted strings that are the same as a keyword
value must be treated as font family names and not as the keyword
value (which must be unquoted).</p>

<h3 id="r15.3.1"><a href="fonts.html#generic-font-families">Section 15.3.1
Generic font families</a></h3>

<p>This section, previously section 15.2.6, has been moved but no
other change was made.</p>

<h3 id="r15.4"><a href="fonts.html#font-styling">Section 15.4
Font styling</a></h3>

<p>The text for this section (formerly part of 15.2.3) has been
reverted to its CSS1 format.</p>

<h3 id="r15.5"><a href="fonts.html#small-caps">Section 15.5
Small-caps</a></h3>

<p>The text for this section (formerly part of 15.2.3) has been
reverted to its CSS1 format.</p>

<p>Clarified that CSS2.1 cannot select font variants besides small-caps.</p>

<p>Clarified that when "font-variant: small-caps" results in the
substitution of full-caps, the behavior is the same as for
text-transform.</p>

<h3 id="r15.6"><a href="fonts.html#font-boldness">Section 15.6
Font boldness</a></h3>

<p>The text for this section (formerly part of 15.2.3) has been
reverted to its CSS1 format. Also, discussion of font-weight from
other parts of the Fonts chapter has been aggregated under this
section.</p>

<p>Removed statemnt that says "User agents must map names to values
in a way that preserves visual order; a face mapped to a value
must not be lighter than faces mapped to lower values." This is
otherwise implied by "The only guarantee is that a face of a given
value will be no less dark than the faces of lighter values."</p>

<h3 id="r15.7"><a href="fonts.html#font-size-props">Section 15.7
Font size</a></h3>

<p>Clarified relationship of font size to em squares.</p>

<p>Added a totally irrelevant note about font sizes virtual reality
scenes.</p>

<h3 id="r16.1"><a href="text.html#indentation-prop">Section 16.1
Indentation</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that text overflowing due to text-indent is affected
by the 'overflow' property.</p>

<p>Added a note about text-indents inheriting behavior and suggesting
'text-indent: 0' on inline-blocks.</p>

<h3 id="r16.2"><a href="text.html#alignment-prop">16.2
Alignment</a></h3>

<p>Changed "double justify" to "justify" under "left, right, center,
and justify".</p>

<h3 id="r16.3.1"><a href="text.html#lining-striking-props">Section 16.3.1
Underlining, over lining, striking, and blinking</a></h3>

<p>Added an example to illustrate how underlining affects descendant
boxes.</p>

<h3 id="r16.5"><a href="text.html#caps-prop">Section 16.5
Capitalization</a></h3>

<p>Switched language reference from RFC2070 to RFC3066.</p>

<h3 id="r16.6"><a href="text.html#white-space-prop">Section 16.6
Whitespace</a></h3>

<p>Added <a href="text.html#q9">section 16.6.1</a> as an example
to illustrate the interaction of white space collapsing and bidi.</p>

<h3 id="r17.1"><a href="tables.html#q1">Section 17.1
Introduction to tables</a></h3>

<p>Expanded introduction to include a brief discussion of the two
table layout models. Mentioned that the automatic table algorithm
is not fully defined in CSS&nbsp;2.1 but that some implementations
have achieved relatively close interoperability.</p>

<h3 id="r17.2"><a href="tables.html#q2">Section 17.2
The CSS table model</a></h3>

<p>Clarify that all table captions must be rendered if more than
one exists.</p>

<p>Specified that replaced elements with table display values are
treated as table elements in table layout.</p>

<h3 id="r17.2.1"><a href="tables.html#anonymous-boxes">Section 17.2.1
Anonymous table objects</a></h3>

<p>Moved the first bullet text to the prose before the list of
generation rules as it is a general statement of what the rules
are supposed to accomplish.</p>

<h3 id="r17.4"><a href="tables.html#q5">Section 17.4
Tables in the visual formatting model</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that "display: table" elements behave as block-level elements
and "display: inline-table" elements behave as inline-level elements and
not the other way around.</p>

<p>Clarified that 'table-caption' boxes behave as normal block boxes
within the outer anonymous table box.</p>

<p>Clarified that percentage 'width' and 'height' on the table box is
relative to the anonymous box's containing block, not the anonymous
box itself.

<p>Clarified that the 'position', 'float', 'top', 'right', 'bottom',
and 'left' values on the table box are used on the anonymous outer
box instead of the table box and that the table box itself uses the
initial values of those properties.</p>

<h3 id="r17.5"><a href="tables.html#q7">Section 17.5
Visual layout of table contents</a></h3>

<p>To remove ambiguity about the position of extent of internal
table boxes, the following paragraph was added after point 6:

<blockquote><p>the edges of the rows, columns, row groups and column
groups in the <a href="tables.html#collapsing-borders">collapsing borders
model</a> coincide with the hypothetical grid lines on which the
borders of the cells are centered. (And thus, in this model, the rows
together exactly cover the table, leaving no gaps; ditto for the
columns.) In the <a href="tables.html#separated-borders">separated borders
model,</a> the edges coincide with the <a
href="box.html#border-edge">border edges</a> of cells. (And thus, in
this model, there may be gaps between the rows and columns,
corresponding to the <span
class="propinst-border-spacing">'border-spacing'</span>
property.)</blockquote>

<p>Changed warning note about positioning of table cells to be more
precise about the possibly unintended effects.</p>

<h3 id="r17.5.1"><a href="tables.html#table-layers">Section 17.5.1 Table layers and
transparency</a></h3>

<p>At the end of the section added the following paragraph:

<blockquote><p>Note that if the table has 'border-collapse: separate',
the background of the area given by the 'border-spacing' property is
always the background of the table element. See 17.6.1</blockquote>

<h3 id="r17.5.2"><a href="tables.html#width-layout">Section 17.5.2 Table width algorithms</a></h3>

<p>Added a paragraph to clarify the interaction of the table width
algorithms with the rules in
<a href="visudet.html#Computing_widths_and_margins">section 10.3</a>
(Calculating widths and margins).</p>

<h3 id="r17.5.2.1"><a href="tables.html#fixed-table-layout">Section 17.5.2.1
Fixed table layout</a></h3>

<p>Explicitly mentioned that the fixed table layout algorithm may be
used with the algorithm of <a href="visudet.html#blockwidth">section
10.3.3</a> when 'table-layout' is 'fixed' but 'width' is 'auto'.</p>

<h3 id="r17.5.2.2"><a href="tables.html#auto-table-layout">Section 17.5.2.2
Automatic table layout</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that UAs can use other algorithms besides the one in
this section <em>even if</em> it results in different behavior.
Also marked the rest of the section non-normative in accordance
with that statement.</p>

<h3 id="r17.5.5"><a href="tables.html#dynamic-effects">Section 17.5.5
Dynamic row and column effects</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that not affecting layout means that 'visibility: collapse'
causes the part of row- and column-spanning cells that span into
the collapsed row to be clipped.</p>

<h3 id="r17.6.1"><a href="tables.html#separated-borders">17.6.1
The separated borders model</a></h3>

<p>Added a note explaining that 'border-spacing' can be used as a
substitute for the non-standard 'framespacing' attribute on
frameset elements (which are out-of-scope for CSS2.1).</p>

<p>Added clarification about backgrounds: the
sentence "This space is filled with the background of the table
element" was replaced by:

<blockquote><p>In this space, the row, column, row group, and column
group backgrounds are invisible, allowing the table background to show
through.</blockquote>

<h3 id="r17.6.2"><a href="tables.html#collapsing-borders">Section 17.6.2
The collapsing borders model</a></h3>

<p>In the sentence after the question, added "and
padding-left<sub>i</sub> and padding-right<sub>i</sub> refer 
to the left (resp., right) padding of cell i."

<h3 id="r18.2"><a href="ui.html#system-colors">Section 18.2
System Colors</a></h3>

<p>Noted that system colors are deprecated in CSS3.</p>

<h3 id="r18.4"><a href="ui.html#dynamic-outlines">Section 18.4
Dynamic outlines</a></h3>

<p>Clarified that outlines do not cause overflow.</p>

<p>Clarified that outlines are only fully connected "if possible".</p>

<h3 id="r18.4.1"><a href="ui.html#q5">Section 18.4.1
Outlines and the focus</a></h3>

<p>Clarify that changing outlines in response to focus
should not cause a document to reflow.</p>

<h3 id="x84"><a href="grammar.html#q2">Appendix G.2 Lexical scanner</a></h3>

<p>Removed the following line from the scanner as it
does not appear in the grammar:</p>

<pre>
"@"{ident}              {return ATKEYWORD;}
</pre>

<p>The DIMEN token is in the scanner to ensure that a number followed
by an identifier is read as one token rather than two. This case
is considered an error in CSS2.
