<H1 align="center">Appendix B: Changes from CSS1</H1>

<P>CSS2 builds on <a rel="biblioentry" href="./refs.html#ref-CSS1"
class="normref">[CSS1]</a> and all valid CSS1 stylesheets are valid
CSS2 stylesheets. The changes between the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">CSS1 specification</a> and this
specification fall into three groups: new functionality, updated 
descriptions of CSS1 functionality, and changes to CSS1.

<H2>New functionality</H2>

<P>In addition to the functionality of CSS1, CSS2 supports:

<UL>

<LI>The concept of <A HREF="media.html">Media types</A>

<LI><A HREF="page.html">Paged media</A>

<LI><A HREF="aural.html">Aural style sheets</A>

<LI><A HREF="fonts.html#font-selection">An extended font selection</A>
mechanism, including intelligent matching, synthesis, and downloadable
fonts.

<LI><A HREF="tables.html">Tables</A>, including new values on <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> and <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span>

<LI><A HREF="flowobj.html#relative-positioning">Relative</A> and <A
HREF="flowobj.html#absolute-positioning">Absolute positioning</A>.

<LI>An extended <A HREF="selector.html">selector</A> mechanism,
including child selectors, adjacent selectors and attribute selectors.

<LI>[generated text?]

<LI>[text-decoration?]

<LI>[hover?]

<LI>[filter?]

</UL>

<H2>Updated descriptions</H2>

<P>The CSS1 specification was short and concise. This specification is
much more voluminous and more readable. Much of the additional content
describes new functionality, but the description of CSS1 features has
also been extended. Except in a few cases described below, the
rewritten descriptions do not indicate a change in syntax nor
semantics. 

<!--
<UL>
<LI>recommends that the user preference is used as the initial value
</UL>
-->

<H2>Changes</H2>

<P>In CSS2

<UL>

<LI>In CSS2 <A HREF="syndata.html#color-units">color values</A> are clipped
with regard to the device gamut, not with regard to the sRGB gamut as
in CSS1.

<LI>[strength of constraints based on writing direction]

<LI>In CSS1, several properties (e.g. 'padding') had values referring
to the width of the parent element. This was an error; the value
should always refer to the width of a block-level element and this
specification reflects this.

</UL>
