<TITLE>Appendix B: Changes from CSS1</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1 align="center">Changes from CSS1</H1>
<P><em>This appendix is informative, not normative.</em></P>

<P>CSS2 builds on CSS1 and all valid CSS1 style sheets are valid CSS2
style sheets. The changes between the CSS1 specification (see
[[CSS1]]) and this specification fall into three groups: new
functionality, updated descriptions of CSS1 functionality, and changes
to CSS1.

<H2>New functionality</H2>

<P>In addition to the functionality of CSS1, CSS2 supports:</p>

<UL>

<LI>The concept of <A HREF="media.html">media types</A>.
	
<LI><A HREF="page.html">Paged media</A>

<LI><A HREF="aural.html">Aural style sheets</A>

<LI><A HREF="fonts.html#font-selection">An extended font selection</A>
mechanism, including intelligent matching, synthesis, and downloadable
fonts. Also, the concept of system fonts has been is introduced, and a
new property, <span
class="propinst-font-size-adjust">'font-size-adjust'</span>, has been added.

<LI><A HREF="tables.html">Tables</A>, including new values on <span
class="propinst-display">'display'</span> and <span
class="propinst-vertical-align">'vertical-align'</span>.

<LI><A HREF="visuren.html#relative-positioning">Relative</A> and <A
HREF="visuren.html#absolute-positioning">Absolute positioning</A>,
including <A HREF="visuren.html#fixed-positioning">fixed positioning</A>.

<LI>An extended <A HREF="selector.html">selector</A> mechanism,
including child selectors, adjacent selectors and attribute selectors.

<LI><A HREF="generate.html#generated-text">Generated content and automatic
numbering</A>

<LI>Text shadows, through the new <LI><span
class="propinst-text-shadow">'text-shadow'</span> property.

<LI>Several new <A
HREF="selector.html#pseudo-classes">pseudo-classes</A>, :first-child, :hover,
:focus, :lang, :target.

<LI><A HREF="ui.html#system-colors">System colors</A>

</UL>



<H2>Updated descriptions</H2>

<P>The CSS1 specification was short and concise. This specification is
much more voluminous and more readable. Much of the additional content
describes new functionality, but the description of CSS1 features has
also been extended. Except in a few cases described below, the
rewritten descriptions do not indicate a change in syntax nor
semantics. 

<!--
<UL>
<LI>recommends that the user preference is used as the initial value
