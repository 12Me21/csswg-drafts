  </TABLE>
  </DIV>

* To mark up property instances:

  <span class="propinst">'prop-name'</span>


************
Concept index markup
************

* To mark up terms for the concept index, use several classes:

  concept-index: Indicates that the term belongs in the index

  The second class may be either "def" or "inst", for whether
  the occurrence is the defining instance of a term or just an
  instance of use.

  The third class will be the term to use in the index.

  [Subsequent class names indicate Nth level index entries]

  <span class="concept-index, inst, cascade">cascading stuff</span>

  [The value of the SPAN element will not be used?]

Examples
************
* In accordance with the HTML spec, use uppercase for
  element names and lowercase for attribute names.
