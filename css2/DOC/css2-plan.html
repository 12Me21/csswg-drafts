<h1>CSS2 Specification Plan</h1>
We will base the CSS2 specification on the HTML 4.0 specification in
      several ways:
<ul>
<li>The structures will be similar (see below) 
<li>Much of the information will be generated from markup (indexes,
links to property definitions from the text, table of contents,
subtables of contents for each chapter, etc.) Ian will work with
Arnaud to adapt the HTML 4.0 binaries and makefiles to CSS2.
</ul>

<P>The CSS2 specification will be written in some "clean" version of
	HTML 4.0. Style sheets for the spec will be linked via the
	LINK element.

<h2>What's in CSS2?</h2>

CSS2 will be created by integrating the following documents or later
versions of them:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/TR/WD-print-970626.html">WD-print-970626.html</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/WD-acss-970606.html">WD-acss-970606.html</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/9705/WD-positioning-970507.html">WD-positioning-970507.html</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/WD-frosting-970626">WD-frosting-970626.html</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/WD-font-970626">WD-font-970626</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Group/9706/WD-css-tables-970624">WD-css-tables-970624</a>
</ul>

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<P>Here's a preliminary proposal for the tables of contents. The lines
with asterisks are notes from discussions. Entries in square brackets
are optional sections to be discussed further. Entries in curly
brackets will be generated from source markup.

<P>Please comment on missing pieces.

<P>This table of contents may vary if documents become too large or if
they naturally combine, etc.

<h2>The implementation of the spec</h2>
The source files of the specification will be located in the following
      CVS module: <strong>WWW/Style/Group/css2-src</strong>.

<P>This module will contain the following subdirectories:
<ul>
<li><strong>DOC</strong> Contains documents for editors:
<ul>
<li>README: How to create the electronic and printed versions of the
	      spec and how to install it in the public space of the
	      Web site. The <tt>Makefile</tt> in the toplevel
	      directory will specify how the spec is created.
<li>CONVENTIONS: Conventions adopted by the editors of the spec (e.g.,
	      quotes around property names, markup to use for
	      generated links, etc.
<li>FILES: The list of files that compose the specification. This list
	      will be used by the process that generates the final
	      spec in all its forms.
</ul>
<li><strong>bin</strong> Contains scripts and programs to build the
	  spec from source files.
<li><strong>build</strong> Contains files (indexes, headers,
	  etc.) generated to build the spec.
<li><strong>images</strong> Contains image files
<li><strong>style</strong> Contains style sheets associated with the
	  spec.
</ul>

<P>All other source files, having the suffix ".srb", will be located
in the toplevel directory. These files will contain HTML 4.0 plus any
macros (to be defined) that may generate HTML during processing).

<h2>Milestones</h2>
<ul>
<li>First draft for CSS WG: August 20
<li>Recommendation: mid-December
</ul>
