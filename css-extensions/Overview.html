<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=1 id=intro><span class=secno>1 </span><span class=content>
Introduction</span><a class=self-link href=#intro></a></h2>

<p>	When authoring CSS,
	one often encounters significant repetition in certain features.
	For example, a given media query might be repeated in several places,
	or a selector meant to apply to all heading elements
	requires specifying <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=":matches(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)">:matches(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)</span> in every location that uses it.

<p>	This repetition makes stylesheets more verbose and difficult to read,
	and also affects maintenance,
	as the author has to keep each repetition in sync when making any changes.

<p>	This specification defines methods for extending several CSS features
	so that a long or repeatedly-used value can be given a short, memorable name instead,
	or a feature can be given a more complex definition controlled by a scripting language.
	This makes stylesheets easier to read,
	and more powerful in general,
	as authors can extend the feature-set of CSS themselves
	rather than waiting for standards bodies to define new features for them.

<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=2 id=extension-name><span class=secno>2 </span><span class=content>
Extension Names</span><a class=self-link href=#extension-name></a></h2>

<p>	All extensions defined in this specification use a common syntax for defining their ”names”:
	the <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=#typedef-extension-name title="<extension-name>">&lt;extension-name&gt;</a> production.
	An <dfn class=css-code data-dfn-type=type data-export="" id=typedef-extension-name>&lt;extension-name&gt;<a class=self-link href=#typedef-extension-name></a></dfn> is any <a data-link-type=dfn href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-syntax-3/#identifier title=identifier>identifier</a> that starts with two dashes (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS),
	like <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=--foo>--foo</span>, or even exotic names like <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=-->--</span> or <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=------>------</span>.
	The CSS language will never use identifiers of this form for any language-defined purpose,
	so it’s safe to use them for author-defined purposes
	without ever having to worry about colliding with CSS-defined names.

<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=3 id=custom-selectors><span class=secno>3 </span><span class=content>
Custom Selectors</span><a class=self-link href=#custom-selectors></a></h2>

<p>	A <dfn data-dfn-type=dfn data-noexport="" id=custom-selector>custom selector<a class=self-link href=#custom-selector></a></dfn> is defined with the <a class=css data-link-type=maybe href=#at-ruledef-custom-selector title=@custom-selector>@custom-selector</a> rule:

<pre class=prod><dfn class=css-code data-dfn-type=at-rule data-export="" id=at-ruledef-custom-selector>@custom-selector<a class=self-link href=#at-ruledef-custom-selector></a></dfn> = @custom-selector <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=#typedef-extension-name title="<extension-name>">&lt;extension-name&gt;</a> <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors-4/#typedef-selector title="<selector>">&lt;selector&gt;</a> ;</pre>
<p>	This defines a <a data-link-type=dfn href=#custom-selector title="custom selector">custom selector</a> which is written as a <a data-link-spec=selectors data-link-type=dfn href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors-4/#pseudo-class title=pseudo-class>pseudo-class</a> with the given <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=#typedef-extension-name title="<extension-name>">&lt;extension-name&gt;</a>,
	and represents a <a class=css data-link-type=maybe href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors-4/#matches-pseudo title=:matches()>:matches()</a> selector using the provided <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors-4/#typedef-selector title="<selector>">&lt;selector&gt;</a> as its argument.

	<div class=example>
		For example, if an author wanted to easily refer to all heading elements in their HTML document,
		they could create an alias:

		<pre>  @custom-selector :--heading h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6;

  :--heading { /* styles for all headings */ }
  :--heading + p { /* more styles */ }
  /* etc */
</pre>	</div>

<h3 class="heading settled heading" data-level=3.1 id=script-custom-selectors><span class=secno>3.1 </span><span class=content>
Script-based Custom Selectors</span><a class=self-link href=#script-custom-selectors></a></h3>

	<div class=issue id=issue-92c93e68><a class=self-link href=#issue-92c93e68></a>
		This one’s more complicated than MQs.
		Brian Kardell came up with a good proposal for evaluating selectors as JS functions that return a boolean,
		which had decent performance characteristics by specifying the qualities of the element it was based on
		(which determined when it would be called).

		<pre>&lt;script&gt;
CSS.customSelector.set("_foo",
                     {"predicate": function(el){...},
                       "matches": "a"});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>		"matches" is an optional selector specifying what subset of elements the custom selector is valid for.
		The selector is automatically false for elements that don’t match,
		and the predicate isn’t called.

<p>		By default, the predicate is called whenever there’s a mutation in an element that matches the "matches" selector,
		or one of its descendants.

<p>		You should be able to suppress the auto-calling,
		and be able to trigger the predicate to run manually.
		That way you can use mutation listeners manually to only call the predicate when necessary.

<p>		We should probably offer some sugar for filtering the list of mutations that trigger the predicate to be called.
		Maybe just a list of attributes that you’ll be caring about?  And/or tagnames?

<p>		Maybe let the pseudo-class also accept an argument,
		and pass it (as a serialized string) as a second argument to the predicate.
		<span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=:_foo>:_foo</span> would pass <code>null</code>,
		while <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=:_foo()>:_foo()</span> would pass <code>""</code>.
	</div>

<h3 class="heading settled heading" data-level=3.2 id=custom-selectors-cssom><span class=secno>3.2 </span><span class=content>
CSSOM</span><a class=self-link href=#custom-selectors-cssom></a></h3>

	<p class=issue id=issue-cb6e966f><a class=self-link href=#issue-cb6e966f></a>
		Fill in.

<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=4 id=custom-property><span class=secno>4 </span><span class=content>
Custom Properties</span><a class=self-link href=#custom-property></a></h2>

	<div class=issue id=issue-234df7b0><a class=self-link href=#issue-234df7b0></a>
		Need to more fully support Custom Properties
		(and eventually remove them from the variable spec entirely, since they’ll be defined here).

<p>		By default, custom properties are optimized for use as <a class=css data-link-type=maybe href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var title=var()>var()</a> values—<wbr>they inherit,
		have an empty initial value,
		don’t do any syntax checking,
		and don’t animate.
		All of these should be adjustable somehow.

		<pre>@custom-property --foo {
  scope: [ inherit | local ];
  initial: <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables-1/#typedef-any-value title="<any-value>">&lt;any-value&gt;</a>*;
  value: <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#length-value title="<length>">&lt;length&gt;</a> <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#length-value title="<length>">&lt;length&gt;</a> <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color-3/#valuea-def-color title="<color>">&lt;color&gt;</a>;
  /* Literally, define a simplistic definition syntax.
     OR FULL CSS PROPERTY GRAMMAR?!? */
}
</pre>
<p>		If you provide a "value" field with animatable types,
		we can animate in the most direct fashion automatically.
		We could also let you hook into that:
		you register a callback,
		and whenever a property starts animating,
		we call it with the starting and ending values.
		You have to return a function which takes a progress value (between 0 and 1)
		and returns a value for your property;
		we’ll call it as we animate the value.
		(How can we hook into Web Anim here? Can you just return an Animation object?)

<p>		Do we need a hook for computed values?  Interesting.
		We could just hand your callback a set of property values for the element and its parent (maybe siblings, if you ask for it?),
		and you can return a new value for the property.
		This is probably an advanced feature for a later date.

<p>		Definitely need a way to listen for elements receiving and changing property values,
		so you can efficiently polyfill things and make your own properties.
		Unsure how it would look at the moment.
	</div>

<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=5 id=custom-functions><span class=secno>5 </span><span class=content>
Custom Functions</span><a class=self-link href=#custom-functions></a></h2>

	<div class=issue id=issue-a45b4c04><a class=self-link href=#issue-a45b4c04></a>
		Interesting possibilities here.
		Definitely need some way to define custom functions in CSS.
		This would, for example, let people define whatever color function they want,
		such as implementing the <a href=http://www.boronine.com/husl/>HUSL</a> color space.

<p>		Definitely need a JS interface.
		What options are needed?

<p>		Call time/frequency:

<p>		<ul>
			<li>
				Default should probably treat the function as a preprocessor,
				calling the JS function once per instance in the stylesheet
				and substituting in the returned value.

			<li>
				Should probably have an option to allow calling per element/instance combo, too.
				Gets called more as match results change.
		</ul>

<p>		We can take some cues from my thoughts on a random() function.
		It needs per-instance,
		per-element&amp;instance,
		and per "identifier", so you can reuse the same value in multiple spots.
		That last one can probably be handled manually by the JS,
		so we don’t have to privilege a particular argument as an identifier.

<p>		We’d need to provide the context in which it’s used.
		Which property, for example.
		Should we allow them to be used in other places,
		or should we just define more contextual locations as we go?
		That is, should we allow custom-defined functions in @supports with this API,
		or should we add a <code>.customSupports</code> map?
		I suspect that individual cases will have their own useful contextual information,
		so it’s better to specialize each instance of custom functions.

<p>		How much can we do in pure CSS?
		Being able to substitute values depending on MQs or support queries would be useful.
		(However, we can do that much just by using custom properties and <a class=css data-link-type=maybe href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var title=var()>var()</a>.)
		To get *real* use out of it, though, I suspect we’d need fuller support for conditionals,
		likely in the form of SASS’s <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=@if>@if</span> or something similar.
	</div>

<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=6 id=custom-combinators><span class=secno>6 </span><span class=content>
Custom Selector Combinators</span><a class=self-link href=#custom-combinators></a></h2>

	<div class=issue id=issue-e3f29f62><a class=self-link href=#issue-e3f29f62></a>
		Selectors are made of two pieces:
		simple selectors,
		and combinators.
		We should allow custom combinators too.

<p>		This is JS-only, because it’s transforming elements, not filtering them,
		and you can’t express any useful transformations in pure CSS.

<p>		You provide a function which,
		when given an element,
		produces a list of zero or more elements.

<p>		For examples, with <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="div /--foo/ span">div /--foo/ span</span>,
		the CSS engine will match the first part of the selector
		and find all the div elements.
		It passes that list to the function registered for the --foo combinator,
		and expects to get a new list of elements returned.
		It then continues on its way,
		filtering that list to include only span elements, etc.

<p>		A child combinator would be something like:

		<pre>CSS.customCombinator.set("--child", function(el) {
    return el.children;
  });
</pre>
<p>		Then <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="div /--child/ span">div /--child/ span</span> would be identical to <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="div > span">div &gt; span</span>.

<p>		If we generalize a selector with a custom combinator to <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="a /--custom/ b">A /--custom/ B</span>,
		then the UA would automatically call the --custom function
		whenever new elements match <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span>.
		If elements stop matching <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span>,
		it won’t bother;
		it’ll just drop them from the result.

<p>		Alternately, the function could take a list of elements
		(all the elements matching <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span>)
		and return a new list of elements.
		This would be a bit more complicated for the author,
		but would allow more variety in the types of combinators that could be defined,
		as you could define things that depend on the entire set of matched elements.
		For example, you could define <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="a /nth 1/ b">A /nth 1/ B</span>
		to give only the first element from the set of <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span> matches.

<p>		(Maybe we allow both variants,
		since the per-element one is easier to optimize and program against,
		but the per-set one allows some useful stuff.)

<p>		Similarly to custom pseudo-classes,
		we’d allow arguments,
		with them parsed eagerly per-instance
		and passed to the combinator function.

<p>		If we do the per-element combinator function,
		we could potentially cache the results,
		so that it never needs to be called again for the same element.
		Possibly have a flag that turns off this behavior,
		so that you’re guaranteed to be called again.
	</div>

<h2 class="heading settled heading" data-level=7 id=custom-atrules><span class=secno>7 </span><span class=content>
Custom At-Rules</span><a class=self-link href=#custom-atrules></a></h2>

	<div class=issue id=issue-ba92a73c><a class=self-link href=#issue-ba92a73c></a>
		This one’s even less developed,
		but it would be interesting to allow custom at-rules as well.
		It’s definitely pure-JS as well.

<p>		Unsure exactly what’s best here.
		Possibly register a callback per rule,
		which is called with the prelude/contents of the at-rule?

<p>		Should we do the callback approach,
		or just maintain a list of custom at-rules
		and let scripts parse them themselves?
		Unfortunately, the latter means we’d have to have a special mechanism to alert scripts
		when new at-rules get added or removed.

<p>		For a lot of these at-rules, we may want a way to know when they’re "applied"—<wbr>when, according to the built-in at-rules like @media and @supports,
		the rule would be applied.

<h3 class="no-ref heading settled heading" id=conformance-classes><span class=content>
Conformance classes</span><a class=self-link href=#conformance-classes></a></h3>

    <p>Conformance to this specification
    is defined for three conformance classes:
    <dl>
        <dt>style sheet
            <dd>A <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet>CSS
            style sheet</a>.
        <dt>renderer
            <dd>A <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent>UA</a>
            that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
            documents that use them.
        <dt>authoring tool
            <dd>A <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent>UA</a>
            that writes a style sheet.
    </dl>

    <p>A style sheet is conformant to this specification
    if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
    according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
    feature defined in this module.

    <p>A renderer is conformant to this specification
    if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
    appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
    by this specification by parsing them correctly
    and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
    UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
    does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
    required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)

    <p>An authoring tool is conformant to this specification
    if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
    generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
    this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
    as described in this module.

<h3 class="no-ref heading settled heading" id=partial><span class=content>
Partial implementations</span><a class=self-link href=#partial></a></h3>

    <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
    assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
    treat as invalid (and <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore>ignore
    as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
    and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
    support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
    ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
    multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
    (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
    be ignored.</p>

<h3 class="no-ref heading settled heading" id=experimental><span class=content>
Experimental implementations</span><a class=self-link href=#experimental></a></h3>

    <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
    reserves a <a href=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords>prefixed
    syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.

    <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
    in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
    experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
    use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
    W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
    in the draft.
    </p>

<h3 class="no-ref heading settled heading" id=testing><span class=content>
Non-experimental implementations</span><a class=self-link href=#testing></a></h3>

    <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
    non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
    release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
    can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.

    <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
    implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
    CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
    testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
    releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
    submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
    Working Group.

    <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
    can be found from on the CSS Working Group’s website at
    <a href=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/>http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
    Questions should be directed to the
    <a href=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite>public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>

		This one’s more complicated than MQs.
		Brian Kardell came up with a good proposal for evaluating selectors as JS functions that return a boolean,
		which had decent performance characteristics by specifying the qualities of the element it was based on
		(which determined when it would be called).

		<pre>&lt;script&gt;
CSS.customSelector.set("_foo",
                     {"predicate": function(el){...},
                       "matches": "a"});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>		"matches" is an optional selector specifying what subset of elements the custom selector is valid for.
		The selector is automatically false for elements that don’t match,
		and the predicate isn’t called.

<p>		By default, the predicate is called whenever there’s a mutation in an element that matches the "matches" selector,
		or one of its descendants.

<p>		You should be able to suppress the auto-calling,
		and be able to trigger the predicate to run manually.
		That way you can use mutation listeners manually to only call the predicate when necessary.

<p>		We should probably offer some sugar for filtering the list of mutations that trigger the predicate to be called.
		Maybe just a list of attributes that you’ll be caring about?  And/or tagnames?

<p>		Maybe let the pseudo-class also accept an argument,
		and pass it (as a serialized string) as a second argument to the predicate.
		<span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=:_foo>:_foo</span> would pass <code>null</code>,
		while <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=:_foo()>:_foo()</span> would pass <code>""</code>.

		Need to more fully support Custom Properties
		(and eventually remove them from the variable spec entirely, since they’ll be defined here).

<p>		By default, custom properties are optimized for use as <a class=css data-link-type=maybe href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var title=var()>var()</a> values—<wbr>they inherit,
		have an empty initial value,
		don’t do any syntax checking,
		and don’t animate.
		All of these should be adjustable somehow.

		<pre>@custom-property --foo {
  scope: [ inherit | local ];
  initial: <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables-1/#typedef-any-value title="<any-value>">&lt;any-value&gt;</a>*;
  value: <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#length-value title="<length>">&lt;length&gt;</a> <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#length-value title="<length>">&lt;length&gt;</a> <a class="production css-code" data-link-type=type href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color-3/#valuea-def-color title="<color>">&lt;color&gt;</a>;
  /* Literally, define a simplistic definition syntax.
     OR FULL CSS PROPERTY GRAMMAR?!? */
}
</pre>
<p>		If you provide a "value" field with animatable types,
		we can animate in the most direct fashion automatically.
		We could also let you hook into that:
		you register a callback,
		and whenever a property starts animating,
		we call it with the starting and ending values.
		You have to return a function which takes a progress value (between 0 and 1)
		and returns a value for your property;
		we’ll call it as we animate the value.
		(How can we hook into Web Anim here? Can you just return an Animation object?)

<p>		Do we need a hook for computed values?  Interesting.
		We could just hand your callback a set of property values for the element and its parent (maybe siblings, if you ask for it?),
		and you can return a new value for the property.
		This is probably an advanced feature for a later date.

<p>		Definitely need a way to listen for elements receiving and changing property values,
		so you can efficiently polyfill things and make your own properties.
		Unsure how it would look at the moment.
	</p><a href=#issue-234df7b0> ↵ </a></div>

<div class=issue>
		Interesting possibilities here.
		Definitely need some way to define custom functions in CSS.
		This would, for example, let people define whatever color function they want,
		such as implementing the <a href=http://www.boronine.com/husl/>HUSL</a> color space.

<p>		Definitely need a JS interface.
		What options are needed?

<p>		Call time/frequency:

<p>		<ul>
			<li>
				Default should probably treat the function as a preprocessor,
				calling the JS function once per instance in the stylesheet
				and substituting in the returned value.

			<li>
				Should probably have an option to allow calling per element/instance combo, too.
				Gets called more as match results change.
		</ul>

<p>		We can take some cues from my thoughts on a random() function.
		It needs per-instance,
		per-element&amp;instance,
		and per "identifier", so you can reuse the same value in multiple spots.
		That last one can probably be handled manually by the JS,
		so we don’t have to privilege a particular argument as an identifier.

<p>		We’d need to provide the context in which it’s used.
		Which property, for example.
		Should we allow them to be used in other places,
		or should we just define more contextual locations as we go?
		That is, should we allow custom-defined functions in @supports with this API,
		or should we add a <code>.customSupports</code> map?
		I suspect that individual cases will have their own useful contextual information,
		so it’s better to specialize each instance of custom functions.

<p>		How much can we do in pure CSS?
		Being able to substitute values depending on MQs or support queries would be useful.
		(However, we can do that much just by using custom properties and <a class=css data-link-type=maybe href=http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-variables-1/#funcdef-var title=var()>var()</a>.)
		To get *real* use out of it, though, I suspect we’d need fuller support for conditionals,
		likely in the form of SASS’s <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=@if>@if</span> or something similar.
	</p><a href=#issue-a45b4c04> ↵ </a></div>

<div class=issue>
		Selectors are made of two pieces:
		simple selectors,
		and combinators.
		We should allow custom combinators too.

<p>		This is JS-only, because it’s transforming elements, not filtering them,
		and you can’t express any useful transformations in pure CSS.

<p>		You provide a function which,
		when given an element,
		produces a list of zero or more elements.

<p>		For examples, with <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="div /--foo/ span">div /--foo/ span</span>,
		the CSS engine will match the first part of the selector
		and find all the div elements.
		It passes that list to the function registered for the --foo combinator,
		and expects to get a new list of elements returned.
		It then continues on its way,
		filtering that list to include only span elements, etc.

<p>		A child combinator would be something like:

		<pre>CSS.customCombinator.set("--child", function(el) {
    return el.children;
  });
</pre>
<p>		Then <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="div /--child/ span">div /--child/ span</span> would be identical to <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="div > span">div &gt; span</span>.

<p>		If we generalize a selector with a custom combinator to <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="a /--custom/ b">A /--custom/ B</span>,
		then the UA would automatically call the --custom function
		whenever new elements match <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span>.
		If elements stop matching <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span>,
		it won’t bother;
		it’ll just drop them from the result.

<p>		Alternately, the function could take a list of elements
		(all the elements matching <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span>)
		and return a new list of elements.
		This would be a bit more complicated for the author,
		but would allow more variety in the types of combinators that could be defined,
		as you could define things that depend on the entire set of matched elements.
		For example, you could define <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title="a /nth 1/ b">A /nth 1/ B</span>
		to give only the first element from the set of <span class=css data-link-type=maybe title=a>A</span> matches.

<p>		(Maybe we allow both variants,
		since the per-element one is easier to optimize and program against,
		but the per-set one allows some useful stuff.)

<p>		Similarly to custom pseudo-classes,
		we’d allow arguments,
		with them parsed eagerly per-instance
		and passed to the combinator function.

<p>		If we do the per-element combinator function,
		we could potentially cache the results,
		so that it never needs to be called again for the same element.
		Possibly have a flag that turns off this behavior,
		so that you’re guaranteed to be called again.
	</p><a href=#issue-e3f29f62> ↵ </a></div>

<div class=issue>
		This one’s even less developed,
		but it would be interesting to allow custom at-rules as well.
		It’s definitely pure-JS as well.

<p>		Unsure exactly what’s best here.
		Possibly register a callback per rule,
		which is called with the prelude/contents of the at-rule?

<p>		Should we do the callback approach,
		or just maintain a list of custom at-rules
		and let scripts parse them themselves?
		Unfortunately, the latter means we’d have to have a special mechanism to alert scripts
		when new at-rules get added or removed.

<p>		For a lot of these at-rules, we may want a way to know when they’re "applied"—<wbr>when, according to the built-in at-rules like @media and @supports,
		the rule would be applied.
