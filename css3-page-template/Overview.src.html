<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents
  (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper,  in speech, etc. This module
  contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;3 relating to pagination templates.
  It includes and extends the functionality of CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]],
  which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1 [[CSS1]].
  The main extension compared to level&nbsp;2 is the ability to specify one or more pagination templates that be used to render content.

<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="status">Status of this document</h2>

<p style="color:red"><strong>This document is a proposal that will need a few iterations before becoming an Editor's Draft. It has not yet been adopted by the Working Group, and should not be considered to be part of CSS.</strong></p>

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p>This module describes how to define pagination templates in CSS. In CSS 2.1 content displayed on-screen is assumed to be a single continuous canvas. Pagination templates provide a mechanism for a 'paginated' experience that applies to on-screen presentation as well as printed media. Pagination templates describe the layout of pages in which content is displayed as the user moves from page to page on screen or prints the document content. When content is laid out using pagination templates, pages are generated as needed to accommodate all the content.

  <p>Pagination templates consist of anonymous boxes called slots created by CSS to contain content. Layouts that use pagination templates mainly determine the size of these slots from the template definition instead of the intrinsic size of their content. When content does not fit into a template slot, additional pages are created with more slots to contain the overflow content.

  <p>Multiple pagination templates can be defined for a given document. A paginated element can use a single template or select from a set of templates each time a new page needs to be generated. Which template is used for a given page can be defined by a selector or by choosing a template based on available content. Elements can further constrain the applicable template set by listing a subset of templates that apply.

  <p class="issue">The terms 'template' and 'page' are overloaded in CSS, but they are the words that most clearly describe the concept. Some alternates for the main @ rule: template, page-template, view-template, page-master, master-template, master. Other suggestions are welcome, but only if they are more helpful than onelook.com (which suggested "Captain Submarine").

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>This module uses named flows and region chains defined in [[CSS3-REGIONS]].
  <p>This module uses the overflow-style property from [[CSS3-GCPM]].
  <p>Some examples use positioning from [[CSS3GRID]].

<h2 id="templates-and-slots">
Pagination Templates and Slots</h2>

  <p>An @template rule defines a pagination template. Pagination templates contain one or more slots to display content. An element can use pagination templates if its 'overflow-style' property is set to any of the paged-* values defined in css3-gcpm. If a document defines no pagination templates, then there is an implicit paginated template with a single slot containing the paginated element's contents.

  <p class="issue">Do pagination templates get their size from the element with the overflow-style property, or can their size be set in the @template rule? Can we use a default 100%/100% size?

  <p>A slot is an anonymous box in a paginated template where content can be placed. In an @template rule @slot rules create slots. The order of @slot rules determines the order of the boxes in the paginated template. Each @slot rule can take an optional name.

  <p>Slots default to displaying the content of the paginated element. Slots can instead contain generated content assigned from the content property. Slots can also be assigned content from named flows.

  <div class='example'>
    <p>An @template rule that creates header and footer slots around the paginated element's content
    <pre>
    @template {
      @slot header { content: "header string"; }
      @slot { }
      @slot footer { content: "footer string"; }
    }
    </pre>
  </div>

  <p>If any slot in a particular page has overflow content, a new page is created with a new set of slots to receive the overflow content. Slots with the same named flow assignment form a region chain (within a pagination template and/or across pages created from pagination templates). When a new page is created a slot assigned element content or content from a named flow may not have any content left to render. In this case the slot for the exhausted content source is not instantiated.

  <p class="issue">If there is more than one slot with no 'content' or 'flow-from' assignment, does the element's content use all of these slots like a region chain, or is only the last unassigned slot used for content?

  <div class='example'>
    <p>The simplest example takes all of the content in the document and flows it into a single paginated template with a single slot. This template will display a viewport's worth of content at a time, and will create a new slot on a new page each time content overflows.

    <p>The three examples below are equivalent, but merely illustrate how content from the element can be assigned to paginated template slots. Actual use of templates would either define more slots or assign content differently than the default.

    <hr>
    <pre>
    body { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <pre>
    body { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    @template {
      @slot { }
    }
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <pre>
    body { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    body > * { flow-into: body-flow; }
    @template {
      @slot { flow-from: body-flow; }
    }
    <hr>
    </pre>
  </div>

  <p class="issue">@slot rules are a first pass at defining CSS-created boxes. Other means of creating and addressing pseudo-element slots have been discussed on www-style. Another possibility is using HTML like  WebComponents does to define the boxes. However the boxes are created there needs to be a way of assigning content to boxes and accessing the template structure through scripting. If pseudo-elements are used, then OM for pseudo-elements must be defined. If HTML templates are used a declarative method of mapping content to elements must be defined.

  <p>Pagination templates can use declarations to determine the layout method for slots. @slot rules can use sizing and positioning declarations.

  <p class="issue">Is there a need to create more structure, nesting slots within slots? If so, then slots can also have layout method declarations?

  <div class='example'>
    <p>A paginated template could contain two side-by-side slots that paginate two separate articles. Side-by-side translations are often laid out this way. This example fills the left side of the paged view with content from an English article and the right side with content from a French article. New pages and slots are created until the content from both articles is exhausted. If one article is longer than the other then in this simple example template the longer article will continue taking up just its half of the page.
    <pre>
    body { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    .english { flow-into: english-flow; }
    .french { flow-into: french-flow; }
    @template {
      @slot left {
        flow-from: english-flow;
        width: 40%;
        padding: 5%;
        float: left;
      }
      @slot right {
        flow-from: french-flow;
        width: 40%;
        padding: 5%
        float: right;
      }
    }
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;article class='english'&gt;...content...&lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;article class='french'&gt;...contenu...&lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class='example'>
    <p>The example above could position the slots using grid layout rather than floats. In this simple example the longer article will take up the entire page once the shorter article is exhausted.
    <pre>
    body { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    .english { flow-into: english-flow; }
    .french { flow-into: french-flow; }
    @template {
      display: grid;
      grid-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      @slot left {
        flow-from: english-flow;
        padding: 5%;
        grid-column: 1;
      }
      @slot right {
        flow-from: french-flow;
        padding: 5%
        grid-column: 2;
      }
    }
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;article class='english'&gt;...content...&lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;article class='french'&gt;...contenu...&lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

<h2 id="conditional-templates">
Template Selection</h2>

  <p>Multiple templates can be defined for a single document. An element that uses pagination templates either selects a template from the entire document set or a subset defined by the 'template-set' property. Each page view created uses a single template. This template can be chosen from the applicable set using a selector, by matching content to display using the 'required-flow' and 'available-flow' declarations, or just taking the first template found.

  <div class='example'>
    <p>In this example the divs are paginated using the first template found from the set of templates that apply to the div. The first div uses template one, the second div uses template two, and the third div uses template three.

    <pre>
    div { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    .either-two-or-three { template-set: two three; } 
    .only-three { template-set: three; } 

    @template one { ... }
    @template two { ... }
    @template three { ... }

    &lt;div class='any-template'&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='either-two-or-three'&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class='only-three'&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  <p class="issue">Instead of specifying a template-set, should there be a way of scoping @template rules to an element? The reason not to is to be able to re-use pagination templates with multiple elements.

<h3 id='ordered-templates'>
Selecting Templates by Page Order</h3>

  <p>Selectors such as :first can be used on a paginated template to define a separate template for pages that match the selector.

  <p class="issue">Should we use :left and :right and allow viewing more than one page at a time in a viewport? Should we have :nth(x) selectors?

  <p class="issue">Describe how @template rules with selectors cascade.

  <div class='example'>
    <p>Any of the side-by-side two-article examples from the previous section could have an @template :first {} rule that defined a fancy layout for the first page.
    <p class="issue">define "fancy."
    <pre>
    @template :first {
      @slot left {
        //fancy styling
        flow-from: article1;
      }
      @slot right {
        //fancy styling
        flow-from: article2;
      }
    }
    </pre>
  </div>

<h3 id='selection-from-available-content'>
Selecting Templates from Required Flows</h3>

  <p>The 'required-flow' property can be used in a paginated template to list named flows that must still have content in order for the template to be used. If more than one template has a 'required-flow' value that matches the remaining flow content, the first template that matches will be used.

  <div class='example'>
    <p>"Continued on" layout.
    <p>Using the same two-article markup as in previous examples, these pagination templates will display an inital page with the beginning of both articles. If the lead story has more content than will fit on that first page, the next pages will show only content from that lead story. When the content from the lead story is consumed, then pages will follow with content from the related article.
    <pre>
    body { overflow-style: paged-x; }
    .lead-story { flow-into: first-flow; }
    .related-article { flow-into: second-flow; }
    @template :first {
      @slot left {
        flow-from: first-flow;
        width: 40%;
        padding: 5%;
        float: left;
      }
      @slot right {
        flow-from: second-flow;
        width: 40%;
        padding: 5%
        float: left;
      }
    }
    @template {
      required-flow: first-flow;
      @slot first {
        flow-from: first-flow;
        column-width: 20em;
      }
    }
    @template {
      required-flow: second-flow;
      @slot second {
        flow-from: second-flow;
        column-width: 20em;
      }
    }
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;article class='lead-story'&gt;...content...&lt;/article&gt;
      &lt;article class='related-article'&gt;...content...&lt;/article&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;    
    </pre>
  </div>

<h3 id='selection-from-available-content'>
Selecting Templates from Available Content</h3>
  
  <p>Pagination templates can be selected based on the order of content in the original markup. Content may be split out into one or more named flows, but the original order can be discovered in the markup.

  <p>Pagination templates have a 'primary' content flow. The primary content for a pagination template is usually the content of the paginated element. If no slot displays the element contents, then the primary content of the paginated template is the first named flow in its required-flow declaration.

  <p>When selecting the pagination template for the next page, the primary content flow in the original markup can be scanned to determine whether any out-of-flow content in named flows was originally related to the next page of primary flow. If this is the case, then those named flows have 'available' content for the purpose of selecting an appropriate template that can display this content.

  <p>Pagination templates can have an 'available-flow' declaration listing the named flows that must have available content relative to the pagination template's primary flow.

  <p class="issue">Expand this.

  <p class="issue">IDPF has a notion of 'available' content. For example, consider a content source that contains a single article with images scattered throughout. Assign the images to a flow named 'images' and the rest of the article to a flow named 'text'. Then define two pagination templates - one that has slots only for the text flow, and another that has slots for both the text and images flows. Each time a page is laid out, the original article is scanned to see whether an image element would have shown up on the page. If so, then that content from the 'images' flow is available for the purpose of selecting a template.

  <div class='example'>
    <p>Assume you have an article that contains both pull quotes and images. If only images <em>or</em> pull quotes would occur on a page, position those elements in the center right of the template. But if both images <em>and</em> pull quotes would appear, position the images in the top left and the pull quotes in the bottom right.
    <p class="issue">code this example
  </div>

<h2 id="cssom">
CSS Object Model Modifications</h2>

  <p class='issue'>There should be extensive OM defined to access pages and slots. What page is being displayed should be available. Templates, pages and slots should be able to accept event handlers. Anchors should navigate to the appropriate page (as should search). What content fits in each slot and page should be accessible. Lots to fill out here.

<h2 id="conformance">
Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>

  <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
  descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
  “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
  “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
  letters in this specification.
  
  <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
  explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
  
  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
  or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
  like this:
  
  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
  normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
  
  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance Classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      </dt><dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    </dd><dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    </dd><dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dd></dl>
  
  <p>A style sheet is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
  if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
  have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
  individual grammars of each property as given in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var> by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to <var class="replaceme">CSS TEMPLATE Module</var>
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>
  
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
  
  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>
 
<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
  
  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.
  
  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p class="issue">[Change or remove the following CR exit criteria if
  the spec is not a module, but, e.g., a Note or a profile. This text was <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a>]</p>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent </dt><dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    </dd><dt>interoperable </dt><dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    </dd><dt>implementation </dt><dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class="inline">
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      </li><li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      </li><li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </li></ol>
  </dd></dl>
  
  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.
