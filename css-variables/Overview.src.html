<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper,  in speech, etc. This module contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;3 relating to variables. It includes and extends the functionality of CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]], which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1 [[CSS1]]. The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;2 are the introduction of the variable as a new primitive value type that is accepted by all properties.

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em></p>

	<p>Large documents or applications (and even small ones) can contain quite a bit of CSS.  Many of the values in the CSS file will be duplicate data; for example, a site may establish a color scheme and reuse three or four colors throughout the site.  Altering this data can be difficult and error-prone, since it's scattered throughout the CSS file (and possibly across multiple files), and may not be amenable to Find-and-Replace.</p>

	<p>This module introduces a family of custom user-defined properties known collectively as <i>data properties</i>, which allow an author to assign arbitrary values to a property with an author-chosen name, and then use those values in other properties elsewhere in the document.  This makes it easier to read large files, as seemingly-arbitrary values now have informative names, and makes editting such files much easier and less error-prone, as one only has to change the value once, at the variable definition site, and the change will propagate to all uses of that variable automatically.</p>

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

	<p>This module defines a new type of primitive value, the <i>variable</i>, which is accepted by all properties.</p>

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>This specification follows the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
	definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
	this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
	Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
	example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the
	definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>
	
<h2 id="defining-variables">
Defining Variables</h2>

	<p>A <dfn>variable</dfn> is defined by assigning a value to a property whose name starts with the prefix "data-" (this class of properties will be referred to <i>data properties</i>).  <em>Any</em> property with the "data-" prefix is defined to be valid but meaningless, and will never be given a specific meaning or effect by a CSS specification or user agent; this is similar to the <code>data-*</code> family of custom attributes in HTML.</p>

	<table class='propdef'>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:</th>
			<td><dfn id='data-property' title='data property|data properties'>data-*</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Values:
			<td><div class='issue'>Figure this out - restricted or wide-open</div>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td><div class='issue'>???</div>
		<tr>
			<th>Applies To:
			<td>all elements
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value:
			<td>specified value
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>all
	</table>

	<div class=example>
		<p>This style rule:</p>

		<pre>
:root {
  data-header-color: #06c;
}</pre>

		<p>declares a <i>data property</i> named "data-header-color" on the root element, and assigns to it the value "#06c".  This property is then inherited to the elements in the rest of the document, and its value can then be used in any place where it would be valid, such as:

		<pre>h1 { background-color: data(header-color); }</pre>
	
		<p>The preceding rule is equivalent to writing ''background-color: #06c;'', except that the variable name makes the origin of the color clearer, and if ''data(header-color)'' is used elsewhere in the stylesheet, all of the uses can be updated at once by changing the variable declaration.</p>
	</div>

	<p>There is no restriction on the possible names for <i>data properties</i>, except that they must start with "data-" and be a valid identifier like any other property name.  Data properties are ordinary properties, so they can be declared on any element, are resolved with the normal inheritance and cascade rules, can be made conditional with ''@media'' and other conditional rules, can be used in HTML's <code>style</code> attribute, can be read or set using the CSSOM, etc..</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>If a variable is declared multiple times, the standard cascade rules help resolve it:</p>

		<pre>
:root { data-color: blue; }
div { data-color: green; }
#alert { data-color: red; }
* { color: data(color); }

&lt;p>I'm blue!&lt;/p>
&lt;div>I'm green!&lt;/div>
&lt;div id='alert'>
  And I'm red!
  &lt;p>So am I, because of inheritance!&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></pre>
	</div>

	<p><i>Data properties</i> may use variables in their own values to build up composite variables.  This can create cyclic dependencies where two or more variables attempt to use each other's value; doing so makes all the data properties involved in the cycle define <i>invalid variables</i> instead of the values they had intended to define.</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>This example shows a variable safely depending on another:</p>

		<pre>
:root {
	data-main-color: #c06;
	data-accent-background: linear-gradient(to top, data(main-color), white);
}</pre>

		<p>The 'data-accent-background' property will automatically update when the 'data-main-color' property is changed.</p>
	</div>

	<div class='example invalid-example'>
		<p>On the other hand, this example shows an invalid instance of variables depending on each other:</p>

		<pre>
:root {
	data-one: calc(data(two) + 20px);
	data-two: calc(data(one) - 20px);
}</pre>

		<p>Both 'data-one' and 'data-two' now define <i>invalid variables</i> rather than lengths.</p>
	</div>

	<div class='issue'>
		<p>Is it possible to do a "cyclic" dependency safely?</p>

		<pre>
&lt;one>&lt;two>&lt;three />&lt;/two>&lt;/one>
one   { data-foo: 10px; }
two   { data-bar: calc(data(foo) + 10px); }
three { data-foo: calc(data(bar) + 10px); }</pre>

		<p>If I'm thinking correctly, one and two would get the value ''10px'' for ''data(foo)'', but three overrides 'data-foo' with a new definition.  It gets the *inherited* value of 'data-bar', which is ''calc(10px + 10px)'' (or maybe just ''20px'' - ''calc()'' computed values aren't well defined yet), so it seems like it validly sets 'data-foo' to ''30px''.  Right?</p>
	</div>

	<p>Variables can refer to other variables in their value.  If a dependency cycle is created, all the declarations that directly contribute to the cycle define <i>invalid variables</i>.</p>

	<p>Before they are defined by a <i>data property</i>, all variables are <i>invalid variables</i>.</p>

<h2 id='using-variables'>
Using Variables</h2>

	<p>A variable can be used anywhere a value is expected in CSS.  Variables can not be used as property names, selectors, or anything else besides property values - doing so either produces an invalid value or, in some situations like the attribute value of an attribute selector, a valid value that nonetheless has no relation to the variable of that name.</p>

	<p>A variable is substituted for its value in the property value at computed-value time.  If a declaration, once all variables are substituted in, is invalid, the declaration is <i>invalid at computed-value time</i>.</p>

	<div class='note'>
		<p>I'm not sure how to precisely define where/how variables can be used.  The Grammar section has a perfect definition, if only it weren't all non-normative (because it's just extending the 2.1 grammar).  I don't know if 2.1 actually has a term for what is represented by the "term" production in the 2.1 grammar.</p>

		<p>Basically, though, variables are lexically substituted into the property value, with restrictions on where they can appear as implied by the Grammar section.  You can't, for example, do something ridiculous like ''@var $unit px; div { width: 20$unit; }''.</p>
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>For example, the following usage is fine from a syntax standpoint, but results in nonsense when the variable is substituted in:</p>

		<pre>
@var $looks-valid 20px;
p { background-color: $looks-valid; }</pre>

		<p>Since ''20px'' is an invalid value for 'background-color', this instance of the property computes to 'transparent' (the initial value for 'background-color') instead.</p>
	</div>

<h3 id='using-invalid-variables'>
Using Invalid Variables</h3>

	<p>An <dfn title="invalid variable|invalid variables">invalid variable</dfn> results from having variables directly or indirectly refer to themselves, or from using an undefined variable.  Using an <i>invalid variable</i> in a property value makes the declaration <i>invalid at computed-value time</i>.</p>

	<p>A declaration that is <dfn>invalid at computed-value time</dfn> results from either using an <i>invalid variable</i> in a property value, or using a valid variable that produces an invalid declaration when it is substituted in.  When this happens, the declaration must compute to the property's initial value.</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>For example, in the following code:</p>

		<pre>
@var $not-a-color 20px; 
p { background-color: red; }
p { background-color: $not-a-color; }</pre>

		<p>the &lt;p> elements will have transparent backgrounds (the initial value for 'background-color'), rather than red backgrounds.  The same would happen if the variable itself was invalid (such as if it was part of a cycle) or undefined.</p>

		<p>Note the difference between this and what happens if the author had just written ''background-color: 20px'' directly in their stylesheet - that would be a normal syntax error, which would cause the rule to be discarded, so the ''background-color: red'' rule would be used instead.</p>
	</div>

	<p class='note'>The <i>invalid at computed-value time</i> concept exists because variables can't "fail early" like other syntax errors can, so by the time the user agent realizes a property value is invalid, it's already thrown away the other cascaded values.  I think ''attr()'' needs to rely on it as well, as its behavior is almost identical to variables.</p>

<h2 id='cssom'>
APIs</h2>

	<p>CSS Variables are mutable - one can change them after they've been defined, through the CSSOM.  This can be done in two ways: one can read the current variable definition and set an override definition through the convenient <code>.vars</code> property, or manipulate the definitions in the stylesheets directly through the standard CSSOM stylesheet interface.</p>

<h3 id='cssom-simple'>
The Simple API</h3>

	<p class='issue'>Not exactly sure how to define this, but I want to put a 'css' property on <code>document</code> (and hopefully <code>window</code>) as a hook for this and other future CSS apis.  <code>document.css</code> would then expose a 'vars' property that implements CSSOverrideVariablesMap.  Variables are document-global, so they need to be exposed at the document level, not the stylesheet level.</p>

	<p class='issue'>Do I need to define the concept of the override stylesheet?  Several browsers already expose this concept of a script-only stylesheet that overrides all other stylesheets.</p>

	<p>The CSSOverrideVariablesMap presents a simple interface to the variables in the override stylesheet, which take precedence over variables defined elsewhere in the document.  As a convenience, it also allows reading normal variables defined elsewhere in the document, as long as there is no variable with the same name in the override stylesheet.</p>

	<pre class='idl'>
[NoInterfaceObject] CSSOverrideVariablesMap {
  getter any (DOMString variableName);
  setter void (DOMString variableName, any variableValue);
  creator void (DOMString variableName, any variableValue);
  deleter void (DOMString variableName);
}</pre>

	<p>On getting, if a variable named <var>variableName</var> exists in the override stylesheet, return its value.  Otherwise, if a variable named <var>variableName</var> is defined in the document, return its value.  Otherwise, return null.</p>

	<p>On setting, find the variable named <var>variableName</var> in the override stylesheet and set its value to <var>variableValue</var>.</p>

	<p>On creating, append a new variable rule to the override stylesheet, with the variable name set to <var>variableName</var> and the value set to <var>variableValue</var>.</p>

	<p>On deleting, remove the variable with the name <var>variableName</var> from the override stylesheet.</p>

<h2 id='grammar'>
The Grammar of Variables</h2>

	<p class='issue'>I'm not sure if I've done this section correctly.  For now, I'll try my best to copypasta what Conditionals is doing, since dbaron usually know what's what.</p>

	<p>This specification extends the lexical scanner in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html">Grammar of CSS 2.1</a> (<a href="#CSS21" rel="biblioentry">[CSS21]<!--{{!CSS21}}--></a>, Appendix G) by adding:</p>

	<pre>
@{V}{A}{R}    {return VARIABLE_SYM;}
"$"name       {return VARIABLE;}</pre>

	<p>and the grammar by adding:</p>

	<pre>
variable_rule
  : VARIABLE_SYM S+ variable_name S+ expr ':';
  ;</pre>

	<p>and by amending:</p>

	<pre>
stylesheet
  : [ CHARSET_SYM STRING ';' ]?
    [S|CDO|CDC]* [ import [ CDO S* | CDC S* ]* ]*
    [ [ ruleset | media | page <ins>| variable_rule</ins> ] [ CDO S* | CDC S* ]* ]*
  ;

  ;</pre>

	<p class='issue'>This uses the 'nested_statement' production from Conditionals.  That should make its way to a proper draft, like a new release of Syntax.</p>

	<p class='issue'>Should variables be usable elsewhere, like in the value of a MQ?</p>

<h2 id="conformance">
Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>

	<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
	“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
	“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification.
	
	<p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
	explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
	
	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:
	
	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
	</div>
	
	<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
	
	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance Classes</h3>

	<p>Conformance to CSS Variables Module
	is defined for three conformance classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
			style sheet</a>.
		<dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
			documents that use them.
		<dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that writes a style sheet.
	</dl>
	
	<p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Variables Module
	if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
	have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
	individual grammars of each property as given in this module.
	
	<p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Variables Module
	if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
	appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
	by CSS Variables Module by parsing them correctly
	and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
	UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
	does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
	required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
	
	<p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Variables Module
	if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
	generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
	this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
	as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

	<p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
	assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
	treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
	as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
	and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
	support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
	ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
	multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
	(as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
	be ignored.</p>
	
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

	<p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
	reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
	syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
	
	<p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
	in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
	experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
	use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
	W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
	in the draft.
	</p>
 
<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

	<p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
	non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
	release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
	can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
	
	<p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
	implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
	CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
	testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
	releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
	submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
	Working Group.
	
	<p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
	can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
	Questions should be directed to the
	<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
	mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

	<p class=issue>[Change or remove the following CR exit criteria if
	the spec is not a module, but, e.g., a Note or a profile. This text was <a
	href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a>]</p>

	<p>
	For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
	there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
	of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
	products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
	a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
	following terms:
	
	<dl>
		<dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
		different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
		used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
		have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
		exempt from this requirement.
	
		<dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
		official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
		browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
		suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
		agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
		if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
		must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
		equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
		interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
		available for the purposes of peer review.
	
		<dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
	
		<ol class=inline>
			<li>implements the specification.
	
			<li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
			be a shipping product or other publicly available version
			(i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
			Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
			feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
			demonstrate stability.
	
			<li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
			to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
			going forward).
		</ol>
	</dl>
	
	<p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
	six months.
