<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper,  in speech, etc. This module contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;3 relating to variables. It includes and extends the functionality of CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]], which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1 [[CSS1]]. The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;2 are the introduction of the variable as a new primitive value type that is accepted by all properties.

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		Large documents or applications 
		(and even small ones) 
		can contain quite a bit of CSS.  
		Many of the values in the CSS file will be duplicate data; 
		for example, 
		a site may establish a color scheme 
		and reuse three or four colors throughout the site.  
		Altering this data can be difficult and error-prone, 
		since it's scattered throughout the CSS file 
		(and possibly across multiple files), 
		and may not be amenable to Find-and-Replace.

	<p>
		This module introduces a family of custom user-defined properties known collectively as <i>variable properties</i>, 
		which allow an author to assign arbitrary values to a property with an author-chosen name, 
		and then use those values in other properties elsewhere in the document.  
		This makes it easier to read large files, 
		as seemingly-arbitrary values now have informative names, 
		and makes editing such files much easier and less error-prone, 
		as one only has to change the value once, 
		at the variable definition site, 
		and the change will propagate to all uses of that variable automatically.

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

	<p>
		This module defines a new type of primitive value, 
		the <i>variable</i>, 
		which is accepted by all properties.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>
		This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. 
		Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]]. 
		Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: 
		for example [[CSS3COLOR]], 
		when combined with this module, 
		expands the definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.
	
<h2 id="defining-variables">
Defining Variables With Variable Properties</h2>

	<p>
		This specification defines an open-ended set of properties called <i>variable properties</i>, 
		which are used to define <i>variables</i>.

	<table class='propdef'>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:</th>
			<td><dfn>var-*</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Values:
			<td><var>&lt;value></var>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>(nothing, see prose)
		<tr>
			<th>Applies To:
			<td>all elements
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value:
			<td>specified value with variables substituted (but see prose for "invalid variables")
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>all
	</table>

	<p>
		The <dfn id='value-type'><var>&lt;value></var></dfn> type used in the syntax above is defined as 
		anything matching the "value" production in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#tokenization">CSS 2.1 Chapter 4.1</a> [[!CSS21]].
		This puts almost no restrictions on what kinds of values you can store in variables.
		Obviously, any valid property value
		or component of a property
		is allowed.
		Additionally, this allows things that aren't yet valid CSS,
		like unknown keywords or functions,
		blocks,
		at-rules,
		and other kinds of custom micro-syntaxes like what's allowed in calc().
		There <em>are</em> still rules, however;
		for example,
		unbalanced parentheses are invalid.

	<p>
		The initial value of a <i>variable property</i> is an empty invalid value.
		This means that, 
		until a <i>variable property</i> is explicitly defined otherwise by a style sheet,
		it defines an <i>invalid variable</i>

	<p>
		The term <dfn title="variable property|variables properties">variable property</dfn> refers to any property
		whose name is composed of a "var-" prefix 
		followed by something matching the IDENT production in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#tokenization">CSS2.1 Chapter 4</a>.
		A <i>variable property</i> defines a value for a corresponding <i>variable</i> 
		with the same name as the property except that the "var-" prefix is replaced with a "$" prefix.

	<p class='issue'>
		As defined here, 
		the syntax for variable usage is different from the syntax for variable definition 
		(i.e. var-foo for definition, $foo for usage).
		It might be nice to have the syntaxes match,
		using "$foo" as the property name as well.
		This would require a minor change in the Core Grammar.

	<p>
		<i>Variable properties</i> are defined to be valid but meaningless 
		as they are meant solely for allowing authors to pass custom data around their page, 
		similar to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/global-attributes.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes">custom data attributes</a> in HTML.  
		Other specifications and user agents must not assign a particular meaning to <i>variable properties</i> 
		or attach a specific effect to them beyond the bare minimum that comes from them being valid properties.

	<p>
		This specification reserves the use of all function tokens starting with the prefix "var" within variable properties.  
		Authors must not use any such functions 
		except as defined in this specification or future updates.  
		If a variable property contains such a function, 
		it must match the grammar defined in this specification or future updates; 
		the use of such a function that does not follow the grammar, 
		or that utilizes such a function that is not yet defined, 
		makes the variable property invalid and it must be ignored.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example, 
			even though this spec doesn't define a ''var-inherit()'' function, 
			that name is reserved by default and cannot be used.  
			Similarly, 
			the ''var()'' function <em>is</em> defined by this spec, 
			so any use of it must match the definition in the spec.  
			The following property declarations are thus invalid:

		<pre>
:root { 
  var-foo: var-inherit(bar);   /* Use of reserved, but undefined, function. */
  var-foo: var(bar, baz, qux); /* Invalid use of var() function. */
}</pre>
	</div>

	<p>
		For each <i>variable property</i>, 
		there is an associated variable with the same name save for the "var-" prefix.  
		For example, 
		a variable property named "var-foo" is associated with the variable named "foo".  
		See the next chapter for details on how to use variables.

	<div class=example>
		<p>
			This style rule:

		<pre>
:root {
  var-header-color: #06c;
}</pre>

		<p>
			declares a <i>variable property</i> named "var-header-color" on the root element, 
			and assigns to it the value "#06c".  
			This property is then inherited to the elements in the rest of the document.  
			Its value can be referenced via the "header-color" variable:

		<pre>h1 { background-color: var(header-color); }</pre>
	
		<p>
			The preceding rule is equivalent to writing ''background-color: #06c;'', 
			except that the variable name makes the origin of the color clearer, 
			and if ''var(header-color)'' is used on other elements in the document, 
			all of the uses can be updated at once 
			by changing the 'var-header-color' property on the root element.
	</div>

	<p>
		Variable properties are ordinary properties, 
		so they can be declared on any element, 
		are resolved with the normal inheritance and cascade rules, 
		can be made conditional with ''@media'' and other conditional rules, 
		can be used in HTML's <code>style</code> attribute, 
		can be read or set using the CSSOM, etc..

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			If a <i>variable property</i> is declared multiple times, 
			the standard cascade rules help resolve it.  
			Variables always draw from the computed value of the associated variable property on the same element:

		<pre>
:root { var-color: blue; }
div { var-color: green; }
#alert { var-color: red; }
* { color: var(color); }

&lt;p>I inherited blue from the root element!&lt;/p>
&lt;div>I got green set directly on me!&lt;/div>
&lt;div id='alert'>
  While I got red set directly on me!
  &lt;p>I'm red too, because of inheritance!&lt;/p>
&lt;/div></pre>
	</div>

	<p>
		<i>Variable properties</i> may use variables in their own values to build up composite variables.  
		This can create cyclic dependencies 
		where two or more <i>variable properties</i> each attempt to use the variable that the other defines; 
		doing so makes all the <i>variable properties</i> involved in the cycle 
		compute to their initial value (which is a guaranteed-invalid value).

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			This example shows a variable property safely using a variable:

		<pre>
:root {
	var-main-color: #c06;
	var-accent-background: linear-gradient(to top, var(main-color), white);
}</pre>

		<p>
			The 'var-accent-background' property will automatically update when the 'var-main-color' property is changed.
	</div>

	<div class='example invalid-example'>
		<p>
			On the other hand, 
			this example shows an invalid instance of variables depending on each other:

		<pre>
:root {
	var-one: calc(var(two) + 20px);
	var-two: calc(var(one) - 20px);
}</pre>

		<p>
			Both 'var-one' and 'var-two' now define <i>invalid variables</i> rather than lengths.
	</div>

	<p>
		It is important to note that 
		<i>variable properties</i> resolve any <i>variables</i> in their values at computed-value time, 
		which occurs <em>before</em> the value is inherited.  
		In general, 
		cyclic dependencies occur only when multiple variable properties on the same element refer to each other; 
		variable properties defined on elements higher in the element tree can never cause a cyclic reference with properties defined on elements lower in the element tree.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example, 
			given the following structure, 
			these variable properties are <strong>not</strong> cyclic, 
			and all define valid variables:

		<pre>
&lt;one>&lt;two>&lt;three />&lt;/two>&lt;/one>
one   { var-foo: 10px; }
two   { var-bar: calc(var(foo) + 10px); }
three { var-foo: calc(var(bar) + 10px); }</pre>

		<p>
			The &lt;one> element defines a value for 'var-foo'.  
			The &lt;two> element inherits this value, 
			and additionally assigns a value to 'var-bar' using the ''foo'' variable.  
			Finally, 
			the &lt;three> element inherits the 'var-bar' value 
			<em>after</em> variable substitution 
			(in other words, it sees the value ''calc(10px + 10px)''), 
			and then redefines 'var-foo' in terms of that value.  
			Since the value it inherited for 'var-bar' no longer contains a reference to the 'var-foo' property defined on &lt;one>, 
			defining 'var-foo' using the ''var(bar)'' variable is not cyclic, 
			and actually defines a value that will eventually 
			(when referenced as a variable in a normal property) 
			resolve to ''30px''.
	</div>

	<p>
		The initial value of a <i>variable property</i> 
		is a special invalid value which makes the associated variable an <i>invalid variable</i>.  
		This is represented by the keyword ''invalid'', 
		but that keyword has no special meaning in itself, 
		and is valid if set explicitly in a variable property.

	<div class='example'>
		<pre>
&lt;div>
  &lt;p>Sample text&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;style>
p { var-foo: invalid; }
div,p { font-family: var(foo); }
&lt;/style></pre>

		<p>
			In this example, 
			the "foo" variable is an <i>invalid variable</i> at the time the DIV element references it, 
			because the 'var-foo' property still has its initial value.  
			This causes the DIV's 'font-family' property to compute to the initial value for 'font-family'.

		<p>
			On the other hand, 
			the P element defines an explicit value for the 'var-foo' property.  
			Its 'font-family' property thus references a font named "invalid".
	</div>

<h2 id='using-variables'>
Using Variables</h2>

	<p>
		After assigning a value to a <dfn>variable</dfn>
		with a <i>variable property</i>,
		A <dfn>variable</dfn> allows the value of a <i>variable property</i> on an element 
		to be substituted into another property on the element.
		There are several ways to use variables:
		by name,
		via the ''var()'' notation,
		or via the ''parent-var()'' notation to get at a variable on the element's parent.

	<p>
		A variable can be used in place of any component value in any property on an element.
		Variables can not be used as 
		property names, 
		selectors, 
		or anything else besides property values - 
		doing so either produces an invalid value or, 
		in some situations like the attribute value of an attribute selector, 
		produces a valid value that nonetheless has no relation to the variable of that name.

	<p>
		A variable is substituted for its value in the property value at computed-value time. 
		If a declaration, 
		once all variables are substituted in, 
		is invalid, 
		the declaration is <i>invalid at computed-value time</i>.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example, 
			the following usage is fine from a syntax standpoint, 
			but results in nonsense when the variable is substituted in:

		<pre>
:root { var-looks-valid: 20px; }
p { background-color: $looks-valid; }</pre>

		<p>
			Since ''20px'' is an invalid value for 'background-color', 
			this instance of the property computes to 'transparent' 
			(the initial value for 'background-color') 
			instead.
	</div>


<h3 id='var-glyph'>
The $ Prefix</h3>

	<p>
		The simplest way to use a variable is to refer to it by its name,
		which is the same as the <i>variable property</i> defining it,
		except with the "var-" prefix swapped out for a "$" prefix.
		Formally, the syntax of a variable is:

	<pre><dfn id='type-var'>&lt;var></dfn> = "$" <var>IDENT</var></pre>

	<p>
		...where <var>IDENT</var> is anything matching the IDENT production in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#tokenization">CSS2.1 Chapter 4</a>.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example,
			the following code defines and uses a variable named "main-color".

		<pre>
:root { 
	var-main-color: blue;
}

h1 { 
	color: $main-color;
}</pre>
	</div>

<h3 id='var-function'>
Default Values - the ''var()'' notation</h3>

	<p>
		In some cases,
		it can be useful to provide a "default" value for a variable
		in case the variable isn't defined or is invalid.

	<p>
		For example, if a site uses variables to provide "hooks" for customization,
		expecting the variables to be defined in a separate custom stylesheet,
		the main stylesheet can use default values for its variable
		so that the theming stylesheet can just override the variables it cares about,
		rather than being forced to provide values for all of them.

	<p>
		The ''var()'' notation allows a default value to be specified when referencing a variable.
		The syntax of ''var()'' is:

	<pre><dfn id='default-var-type'>&lt;default-var></dfn> = var( <var>&lt;var></var> [, <var>&lt;value></var> ]? )</pre>

	<p>
		If the variable named by the first argument is valid,
		the variable's value is substituted as normal.
		If it's invalid, and a second argument was provided,
		the value of the second argument is substituted instead.
		Otherwise, the ''var()'' represents an <i>invalid variable</i>.

	<p class='note'>
		Note that using ''var()'' without a second argument offers no benefits
		over using the variable by itself.
		This is allowed for consistency with ''parent-var()'',
		which <em>does</em> do something useful with only one argument.
		Future variable functions will likely be similar.


<h3 id='parent-var-notation'>
Getting the Parent's Variable - the ''parent-var()'' notation</h3>

	<p>
		Several advanced use-cases for variables need
		the ability to reference the value that a variable has on the element's parent,
		rather than on the element itself.  
		This can be accomplished with the ''parent-var()'' notation:

	<pre><dfn id='parent-var-notation-type'>&lt;parent-var></dfn> = parent-var( <var>&lt;var></var> [, <var>&lt;value></var> ]? )</pre>

	<p>
		If the element has a parent,
		and the variable named by the first argument is valid on the parent,
		the variable's value on the parent is substituted as normal.
		Otherwise, if a second argument was provided,
		the value of the second argument is substituted instead.
		Otherwise, the ''parent-var()'' represents an <i>invalid variable</i>.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example,
			''parent-var()'' can be used to implement a behavior that's very similar to the ''toggle()'' notation from [[CSS3VALUES]].
			In this example,
			each nested comment alternates between a white and silver background.

		<pre>
&lt;div class='comment'>
	&lt;div class='main'>
		...
	&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='actions'>&lt;a>Reply&lt;/a> &lt;a>Comment&lt;/a> ...&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;div class='comment'>
	&lt;div class='main'>
		&lt;div class='comment'>
			&lt;div class='main'>
				...
			&lt;/div>
			&lt;div class='actions'>&lt;a>Reply&lt;/a> &lt;a>Comment&lt;/a> ...&lt;/div>
		&lt;/div>
	&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='actions'>&lt;a>Reply&lt;/a> &lt;a>Comment&lt;/a> ...&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;style>
.comment {
	var-bg:  parent-var($bg2, white);
	var-bg2: parent-var($bg, silver);
	background: url(comment.png) $bg;
}
&lt;/style></pre>

		<p>
			The ''toggle()'' notation can't be used here,
			because 'background-color' isn't inherited
			(and thus the nested comments see the initial value of ''transparent'' rather than ''white'' or ''silver'').
			Even if the author explicitly sets ''background-color:inherit'' on <code>&lt;div class='main'></code>
			so that ''toggle()'' can actually see the right value,
			that will make the ".main" elements cover up the 'background-image' that ".comment" has on it as well.
			Because variables don't have any effect on rendering until they're used,
			they can pass these values through the document without these kinds of side effects.

		<p>
			The ''var()'' notation can't be used here either
			as it would immediately produce a cycle between $bg and $bg2,
			making them both invalid.
	</div>

<h3 id='using-invalid-variables'>
Using Invalid Variables</h3>

	<p>
		When a <i>variable property</i> has its initial value, 
		the <i>variable</i> it defines
		represents an <dfn>invalid variable</dfn>.  
		Using an <i>invalid variable</i> in a property value
		(including other <i>variable properties</i>) 
		makes the declaration <i>invalid at computed-value time</i>.

	<p>
		A declaration can be <dfn>invalid at computed-value time</dfn> 
		if it uses an invalid <i>variable</i>, as explained above,
		or if it uses a valid <i>variable</i>,
		but the property value,
		after substituting its <i>variables</i>,
		is invalid.
		When this happens, 
		the computed value of the property is either
		the property's inherited value
		or its initial value
		depending on whether the property is inherited or not, respectively.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example, in the following code:

		<pre>
:root { var-not-a-color: 20px; }
p { background-color: red; }
p { background-color: var(not-a-color); }</pre>

		<p>
			the &lt;p> elements will have transparent backgrounds 
			(the initial value for 'background-color'), 
			rather than red backgrounds.  
			The same would happen if the variable itself was invalid.

		<p>
			Note the difference between this 
			and what happens if the author had just written ''background-color: 20px'' directly in their stylesheet - 
			that would be a normal syntax error, 
			which would cause the rule to be discarded, 
			so the ''background-color: red'' rule would be used instead.
	</div>

	<p class='note'>
		The <i>invalid at computed-value time</i> concept exists 
		because variables can't "fail early" like other syntax errors can, 
		so by the time the user agent realizes a property value is invalid, 
		it's already thrown away the other cascaded values.

<h2 id='cssom'>
CSSOM</h2>

	<p>
		<i>Variable properties</i> are ordinary properties, 
		and can be read or modified using all of the existing CSSOM APIs for reading or modifying properties.

	<p>
		The specification extends the IDL definitions in the CSSOM spec to represent the use of the ''var()'' function.

<h3 id='cssom-cssvariable'>
Interface CSSVariableComponentValue</h3>

	<p>
		The CSSVariableComponentValue interface represents a use of the ''var()'' function.

	<dl>
		<dt>IDL Definition
		<dd>
			<pre class='idl'>
[NoInterfaceObject] interface CSSVariableComponentValue {
           attribute DOMString variableName;
  readonly attribute any variableValue;
}</pre>

		<dt>Attributes
		<dd>
			<dl>
				<dt><code>variableName</code> of type <code>DOMString</code>
				<dd>This attribute represents the argument to the function.  Changing this attribute changes the <i>variable property</i> being referred to.

				<dt><code>variableValue</code> of type <code>any</code>, readonly
				<dd>This attribute represents the value of the <i>variable property</i> the function is referencing.
			</dl>
	</dl>

<h3 id='cssstyledeclaration-interface'>
Additions to the <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> Interface</h3>

	<p class='issue'>
		The set of variable properties is open-ended, 
		so it's not clear how best to represent this.  
		Ideally, 
		the CSSOM would expose the current set of properties 
		with a non-initial value 
		and allow setting of arbitrary properties.  
		The most natural way seems to be to first, 
		set up a getter behavior on the interface somehow that deals with variable properties, 
		and second, 
		set up a <code>vars</code> map that exposes the variable properties that aren't set to their initial value.

Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>

	<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
	“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
	“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification.
	
	<p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
	explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]
	
	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:
	
	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.
	</div>
	
	<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
	
	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance Classes</h3>

	<p>Conformance to CSS Variables Module
	is defined for three conformance classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
			style sheet</a>.
		<dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
			documents that use them.
		<dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that writes a style sheet.
	</dl>
	
	<p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Variables Module
	if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
	have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
	individual grammars of each property as given in this module.
	
	<p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Variables Module
	if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
	appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
	by CSS Variables Module by parsing them correctly
	and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
	UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
	does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
	required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
	
	<p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Variables Module
	if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
	generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
	this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
	as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

	<p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
	assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
	treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
	as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
	and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
	support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
	ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
	multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
	(as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
	be ignored.
	
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

	<p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
	reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
	syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
	
	<p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
	in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
	experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
	use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
	W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
	in the draft.
	
 
<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

	<p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
	non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
	release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
	can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
	
	<p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
	implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
	CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
	testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
	releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
	submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
	Working Group.
	
	<p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
	can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
	Questions should be directed to the
	<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
	mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

	<p>
	For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
	there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
	of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
	products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
	a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
	following terms:
	
	<dl>
		<dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
		different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
		used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
		have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
		exempt from this requirement.
	
		<dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
		official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
		browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
		suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
		agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
		if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
		must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
		equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
		interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
		available for the purposes of peer review.
	
		<dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
	
		<ol class=inline>
			<li>implements the specification.
	
			<li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
			be a shipping product or other publicly available version
			(i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
			Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
			feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
			demonstrate stability.
	
			<li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
			to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
			going forward).
		</ol>
	</dl>
	
	<p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
	six months.
