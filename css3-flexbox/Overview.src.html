Abstract</h2>

	<p>
		The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. 
		In the flex layout model, 
		the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, 
		and can "flex" their sizes, 
		either growing to fill unused space 
		or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent.  
		Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. 
		Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.

Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes &mdash; algorithms which determine
		the size and position of boxes based on their relationships
		with their sibling and ancestor boxes:
	<ul class="compact">
		<li>block layout, designed for laying out documents
		<li>inline layout, designed for laying out text
		<li>table layout, designed for laying out 2D data in a tabular format
		<li>positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard for other elements in the document
	</ul>
	<p>
		This module introduces a new layout mode, <dfn>flex layout</dfn>,
		which is designed for laying out more complex applications and webpages.

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>
	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		Flex layout is superficially similar to block layout.
		It lacks many of the more complex text- or document-centric properties
		that can be used in block layout, such as
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">floats</a> and
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">columns</a>.
		In return it gains simple and powerful tools
		for distributing space and aligning content
		in ways that webapps and complex web pages often need.  
		The contents of a flex container:
	<ul>
		<li>
			can be laid out in any <a href="#flex-direction-property">flow direction</a>
			(leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
		<li>
			can have their order <a href="#flex-flow-row-reverse">reversed</a> or
			<a href="#order-property">rearranged</a> at the style layer
			(i.e., display order can be independent of source order)
		<li>
			can be laid out linearly along a single (<i title="main axis">main</i>) axis or
			<a href="#flex-wrap-property">wrapped</a> into multiple lines along a secondary (<i title="cross axis">cross</i>) axis
		<li>
			can <a href="#flexibility">&ldquo;flex&rdquo; their sizes</a>
			to respond to the available space
		<li>
			can be <a href="#alignment">aligned</a> with respect to their container or each other
		<li>
			can be dynamically <a href="#visibility-collapse">collapsed</a> or uncollapsed
			along the <i>main axis</i> while preserving the container's <i>cross size</i>
	</ul>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Here's an example of a catalog where each item has a title, an photo, a description, and a purchase button.
			The designer's intention is that each entry has the same overall size,
			that the photo be above the text,
			and the purchase buttons aligned at the bottom, regardless of the length of the item's description.
			Flex layout makes many aspects of this design easy:

		<ul>
			<li>
				The catalog uses flex layout to lay out a row of items horizontally,
				and to ensure they're all equal-height.
				Each entry is then itself a column flex container,
				laying out its contents vertically.

			<li>
				Within each entry, content is ordered logically with the title first,
				followed by the description and the photo.
				For a more compelling visual presentation, however,
				'order' is used to pull the image up from later in the content to the top,
				and  'align-self' to center it horizontally.

			<li>
				An ''auto'' margin above the purchase button
				forces it to the bottom of the entry box,
				regardless of the height of the description.
		</ul>

Module interactions</h3>

	<p>
		This module extends the definition of the 'display' property [[!CSS21]],
		adding a new block-level and new inline-level display type
		and defining a new type of formatting context.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>
		This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]].
		Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
		Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types:
		for example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module,
		expands the definition of the <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> value type as used in this specification.

	<p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties defined in this specification also accept the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">''inherit''</a> keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id='box-model'>
Flex Layout Box Model and Terminology</h2>

	<p>
		An element with ''display:flex'' or ''display:inline-flex'' is a <i>flex container</i>.
		Children of a flex container are called <i>flex items</i> and are laid out using the flex layout model.

	<p>
		Unlike block and inline layout,
		whose layout calculations are biased to the writing mode directions,
		flex layout is biased to the <a href="#flex-flow-property">flex flow</a> directions.
		To make it easier to talk about flex layout,
		this section defines a set of flex flow&ndash;relative terms.
		The 'flex-flow' value determines how these terms map
		to physical directions (top/right/bottom/left),
		axes (vertical/horizontal), and sizes (width/height).

<h2 id='flex-containers'>
Flex Containers: the ''flex'' and ''inline-flex'' 'display' values</h2>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td>display
		<tr>
			<th><a href="#values">New value</a>:
			<td><dfn id='display-flex'>flex</dfn> | <dfn id='display-inline-flex'>inline-flex</dfn>
	</table>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn id="display-flex">''flex''</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate a block-level <i>flex container</i> box.

		<dt><dfn id="display-inline-flex">''inline-flex''</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate a inline-level <i>flex container</i> box.
	</dl>

	<p>
		A <dfn>flex container</dfn> establishes a new <dfn>flex formatting context</dfn> for its contents.  
		This is the same as establishing a block formatting context,
		except that flex layout is used instead of block layout: 
		floats do not intrude into the flex container, 
		and the flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents.  

	<p>
		Flex containers are not block containers, 
		and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of block layout don't apply in the context of flex layout.  
		In particular:

	<ul>
		<li>
			all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module have no effect on a flex container.

		<li>
			'float' and 'clear' have no effect on a <i>flex item</i>.

		<li>
			'vertical-align' has no effect on a flex item.
	</ul>

	<p>
		If an element's specified 'display' is ''inline-flex'' 
		and the element is floated or absolutely positioned, 
		the computed value of 'display' is ''flex''.
		The table in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Chapter 9.7</a> is thus amended 
		to contain an additional row, 
		with ''inline-flex'' in the "Specified Value" column 
		and ''flex'' in the "Computed Value" column.

<h2 id='flex-items'>
Flex Items</h2>

	<p>
		The contents of a <i>flex container</i> consists of zero or more <dfn title="flex item|flex item's" id="flex-item">flex items</dfn>:
		each child of a <i>flex container</i>
		becomes a <i>flex item</i>,
		and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a <i>flex container</i>
		is wrapped in an anonymous <i>flex item</i>.
		However, an anonymous flex item that contains only white space
		is not rendered, as if it were ''display:none''.

	<p>
		A <i>flex item</i> establishes a new formatting context for its contents.
		The type of this formatting context is determined by its 'display' value, as usual.
		The computed 'display' of a <i>flex item</i> 
		is determined by applying the table in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Chapter 9.7</a>.
		<span class='note'>This is expected to be superseded by a future specification that defines a new 'display' value for flex items.</span>

	<div class="example">
		<p>Examples of flex items:
		<pre>
&lt;div style="display:flex">

    &lt;!-- flex item: block child -->
    &lt;div id="item1">block&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- flex item: floated element; floating is ignored -->
    &lt;div id="item2" style="float: left;">float&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- flex item: anonymous block box around inline content -->
    anonymous item 3

    &lt;!-- flex item: inline child -->
    &lt;span id="item4">span&lt;/span>

    &lt;!-- flex item:
         even though block layout will split the &lt;span> around
         the &lt;div>, the &lt;span> is still the direct child of the
         flex container, and so becomes the item. -->
    &lt;span>
        item 5
        &lt;div id=not-an-item>item 5&lt;/div>
        item 5
    &lt;/span>
&lt;/div></pre>
	</div>

	<p>
		Some values of 'display' trigger the generation of anonymous boxes.  
		For example, a ''table-cell'' child of a block container is fixed up
		by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">generating anonymous ''table'' and ''table-row'' elements</a> around it. [[!CSS21]]
		This fixup must occur <em>before</em> a flex container's children are promoted to <i>flex items</i>.
		For example, given two contiguous child elements with ''display:table-cell'', 
		an anonymous table wrapper box around them becomes the <i>flex item</i>.

	<p class='note'>
		Future display types may generate anonymous containers (e.g. ruby) or otherwise mangle the box tree (e.g. run-ins).
		It is intended that flex item determination run after these operations.

<h3 id='flex-item-margins'>
Flex Item Margins</h3>
	
<p>
		The margins of adjacent <i>flex items</i> do not collapse.
		Auto margins absorb extra space in that dimension and can be used for alignment
		and to push adjacent flex items apart;
		see <a href="#auto-margins">Aligning with ''auto'' margins</a>.

<h3 id='abspos-flex-items'>
Out-of-flow Items</h3>

	<p>
		Absolutely positioned children of a flex container are not themselves <i>flex items</i>, 
		but they leave behind "placeholders" in their normal position in the box tree. 
		These placeholders are anonymous inline boxes with a width, height, and line-height of ''0'', 
		and they become flex items.

	<p>
		The <i>static position</i> of an absolutely positioned child of a flex container 
		(the position when the 'top'/'right'/'bottom'/'left' properties are ''auto''), then, 
		is the final position of its corresponding placeholder, after flex layout has been performed.

	<p class='note'>
		Note: In most cases, 
		this means that absolutely-positioned items have no effect on flex layout.
		However, when the flex container has ''justify-content: space-between'' or ''justify-content: space-around'', 
		the anonymous flex items wrapping a placeholder will cause there to be two packing spaces
		where there would otherwise be only one, 
		possibly resulting in increased space between two "real" items.

<h3 id='visibility-collapse'>
Collapsed Items</h3>

	<p>
		Specifying ''visibility:collapse'' on a flex item
		causes it to become a <dfn title="collapsed flex item|collapsed">collapsed flex item</dfn>,
		producing an effect similar to ''visibility:collapse'' on a table-row or table-column:
		the collapsed element is removed from rendering entirely,
		but leaves behind a "strut" that keeps the flex line's cross-size stable.
		Thus, if a flex container has only one flex line,
		dynamically collapsing or uncollapsing items
		is guaranteed to have no effect on the flex container's <i>cross size</i>
		and won't cause the rest of the page's layout to "wobble".
		Flex line wrapping <em>is</em> re-done after collapsing, however,
		so the cross-size of a flex container with multiple lines might or might not change.

	<p>
		Though collapsed flex items aren't rendered,
		they do appear in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html#formatting-structure">formatting structure</a>.
		Therefore, unlike on ''display:none'' items [[!CSS21]],
		effects that depend on an element appearing in the formatting structure
		(like incrementing counters or running animations and transitions)
		still operate on collapsed items.

	<p>
		To compute the size of the strut, flex layout is first performed with all items uncollapsed,
		and then re-run with each collapsed item replaced by a strut that maintains
		the original cross-size of the item's original line.
		See the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a>
		for the normative definition of how ''visibility:collapse''
		interacts with flex layout.

	<p class='note'>
		Note that using ''visibility:collapse'' on any flex items
		will cause the flex layout algorithm to repeat partway through,
		re-running the most expensive steps.
		It's recommended that authors continue to use ''display:none'' to hide items
		if the items will not be dynamically collapsed and uncollapsed,
		as that is more efficient for the layout engine.

<h3 id='min-size-auto'>
Implied Minimum Size of Flex Items</h3>

	<p>
		To provide a more reasonable default minimum size for flex containers,
		this specification introduces a new <a href="#min-auto">''auto''</a> value as the initial value
		of the 'min-width' and 'min-height' properties
		defined in CSS 2.1. [[!CSS21]]

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td>min-width, min-height
		<tr>
			<th><a href="#values">New value</a>:
			<td>auto
		<tr>
			<th>New Initial Value:
			<td><strong title="min-width/height:auto">auto</strong>
		<tr>
			<th>New Computed Value:
			<td>the percentage as specified or the absolute length or a keyword
	</table>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="min-width/height:auto" id='min-auto'>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			When used as the value of a flex item's min main size property,
			this keyword indicates a minimum main size of the min-content size.

Display Order: the 'order' property</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Flex items</i> are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the source document.  
		The 'order' property can be used to change this ordering.

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>order</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th><a href="#values">Value</a>:

	</table>

	<p>
		The 'order' property controls the order in which flex items appear within their flex container,
		by assigning them to ordinal groups.

	<p>
		A flex container will lay out its content starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and going up.  
		Items with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they appear in the source document.
		This also affects the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">painting order</a> [[!CSS21]],
		exactly as if the elements were reordered in the document.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>The following figure shows a simple tabbed interface, where the tab for the active pane is always first:

		<div class='figure'><img src="images/flex-order-example.png" alt></div>

		<p>This could be implemented with the following CSS (showing only the relevant code):

		<pre>
.tabs {
	display: flex;
}
.tabs > .current {
	order: -1; /* Lower than the default of 0 */
}</pre>

	</div>

	<p>
		The 'order' property <em>must not</em> affect ordering in non-visual media 
		(such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/">speech</a>).
		Authors <em>must</em> use 'order' only for visual, not logical, reordering of content;
		style sheets that use 'order' to perform logical reordering are non-conforming.
	<p class='note'>
		This is so non-visual media and non-CSS UAs,
		which typically present content linearly,
		can be catered to with a logical source order,
		while 'order' is used to rearrange the visual order.</span>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Many web pages have a similar shape in the markup, 
			with a header on top, 
			a footer on bottom, 
			and then a content area and one or two additional columns in the middle.  
			Generally, 
			it's desirable that the content come first in the page's source code, 
			before the additional columns.  
			However, this makes many common designs, 
			such as simply having the additional columns on the left and the content area on the right, 
			difficult to achieve.  
			This has been addressed in many ways over the years, 
			often going by the name "Holy Grail Layout" when there are two additional columns.  
			'order' makes this trivial.  
			For example, take the following sketch of a page's code and desired layout:

		<div class='code-and-figure'>
			<div><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;header>...&lt;/header>
&lt;div id='main'>
   &lt;article>...&lt;/article>
   &lt;nav>...&lt;/nav>
   &lt;aside>...&lt;/aside>
&lt;/div>
&lt;footer>...&lt;/footer></pre></div>
			<div><img src="images/flex-order-page.svg" width=400 height=360 alt="In this page the header is at the top and the footer at the bottom, but the article is in the center, flanked by the nav on the right and the aside on the left."></div>
		</div>

		<p>
			This layout can be easily achieved with flex layout:

		<pre>
#main { display: flex; }
#main > article { flex:1;         order: 2; }
#main > nav     { width: 200px;   order: 1; }
#main > aside   { width: 200px;   order: 3; }</pre>
		
		<p>
			As an added bonus, 
			the columns will all be <a href="#align-items-stretch">equal-height</a> by default, 
			and the main content will be as wide as necessary to fill the screen.  
			Additionally, 
			this can then be combined with media queries to switch to an all-vertical layout on narrow screens:

		<pre>
@media all and (max-width: 600px) {
	/* Too narrow to support three columns */
	#main { flex-flow: column; }
	#main > article, #main > nav, #main > aside {
		/* Return them to document order */
		order: 0; width: auto;
	}
}</pre>

		<p><small>(Further use of multiline flex containers to achieve even more intelligent wrapping left as an exercise for the reader.)</small>
	</div>

	<p>
		Unless otherwise specified by a future specification, 
		this property has no effect on elements that are not <i>flex items</i>.

	<p class='note'>
		It is expected that future layout modes like Grid Layout
		will also use 'order' for similar purposes.

<h2 id='flex-lines'>
Flex Lines</h2>

	<p>
		A flex container can be either <i>single-line</i> or <i>multi-line</i>, 
		depending on the 'flex-wrap' property:
	<ul> 
		<li>
			A <dfn>single-line</dfn> flex container lays out all of its children in a single line, 
			even if that would cause its contents to overflow.

		<li>
			A <dfn>multi-line</dfn> flex container breaks its <i>flex items</i> across multiple lines to avoid overflowing, 
			similar to how text is broken onto a new line when it gets too wide to fit on the existing line.  
			When additional lines are created, 
			they are stacked in the flex container along the <i>cross axis</i>
			according to the 'flex-wrap' property.
			Every line contains at least one <i>flex item</i>, 
			unless the flex container itself is completely empty.
	</ul>

	<p>
		Once content is broken into lines,
		each line is laid out independently;
		flexible lengths and the 'justify-content' and 'align-self' properties only consider the items on a single line at a time.  

	<p>
		When a flex container has multiple lines, the <i>cross size</i> of each line
		is the minimum size necessary to contain the <i>flex items</i> on the line
		(after aligment due to 'align-self'),
		and the lines are aligned within the flex container with the 'align-content' property.
		When a flex container (even a <i>multi-line</i> one) has only one line,
		the <i>cross size</i> of the line is the <i>cross size</i> of the flex container,
		and 'align-content' has no effect.
		The <i>main size</i> of a line is always the same as the <i>main size</i> of the flex container's content box.  

	<div class=example>
		<p>
			This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally.

		<pre>&lt;style>
#flexbox {
	display: flex;
	flex-flow: row wrap;
	width: 300px;
}
.item {
	width: 80px;
}
&lt;style>

&lt;div id="flexbox">
	&lt;div class='item'>1&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='item'>2&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='item'>3&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='item'>4&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre>

		<p>
			Since the container is 300px wide, only three of the items fit onto a single line.
			They take up 240px, with 60px left over of remaining space.
			Because the 'flex-flow' property specifies a multi-line flex container 
			(due to the ''wrap'' keyword appearing in its value), 
			the flex container will create an additional line to contain the last item.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/multiline-no-flex.svg">

			<figcaption>
				An example rendering of the multiline flex container.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			After wrapping, if the items are made flexible, they'll fill their lines.
			The first line has 60px of remaining space,
			and all of the items have the same flexibility,
			so each of the three items on that line will receives 20px of extra width,
			ending up 100px wide.
			The remaining item is on a line of its own
			and will stretch to the entire width of the line, or 300px.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/multiline-flex.svg">

			<figcaption>
				A rendering of the same as above,
				but with the items all given ''flex: auto;''.

<h2 id='flexibility'>
Flexibility</h2>

	<p>
		The defining aspect of flex layout is the ability to make the <i>flex items</i> "flex", 
		altering their width or height to fill the available space. 
		This is done with the 'flex' property. 
		A flex container distributes free space to its items proportional to their <i>flex grow ratio</i>, 
		or shrinks them to prevent overflow proportional to their <i>flex shrink ratio</i>.

Common Values of 'flex'</h3>

	<p><em>This section is informative.</em>

	<p>
		The list below summarizes the effects of the most common 'flex' values:

	<dl>
		<dt>''flex: initial''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 0 1 auto''.
			The value sets the size of the item according to the 'width'/'height' properties
			and  makes the flex item inflexible when there is positive free space,
			but allows it to shrink to its <a href="#min-size-auto">minimum</a> when there is insufficient space.
			(If the 'width'/'height' used as the <i>flex basis</i> computes to ''auto'', 
			this will size the flex item based on its contents.)
			The alignment properties or ''auto'' margins may be used to align flex items within the flex container.

		<dt>''flex: auto''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 1 1 auto''.
			This value makes the flex item flexible,
			and sets the <i>flex basis</i> according to the 'width'/'height' properties. 
			If all items are either ''flex: auto'' or ''flex: none'',
			any free space after the items have been sized will be distributed evenly to the items with ''flex: auto''.

		<dt>''flex: none''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 0 0 auto''.
			This value makes the flex item inflexible,
			and sets the size of the item according to the 'width'/'height' properties.
			To size things normally but still use the <a href="#alignment">alignment abilities</a> of flex layout,
			set all the flex items to ''flex: none''
			and then use ''auto'' margins or the alignment properties.
			This is similar to ''initial'',
			except that flex items are not allowed to shrink,
			even in overflow situations.

		<dt>''flex: &lt;positive-number>''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: &lt;positive-number> 1 0%''.
			This value makes the flex item flexible,
			and sets the <i>flex basis</i> to zero, resulting in an item that receives the specified proportion of the free space in the flex container.
			If all items in the flex container use this pattern,
			their sizes will be proportional to the specified flex ratio.
	</dl>

	<p>
		By default, flex items won't shrink below their minimum content size
		(the length of the longest word or fixed-size element).
		To change this, set the 'min-width' or 'min-height' property.

<h3 id='flex-components'>

		Individual components of flexibility can be controlled by separate properties.

	<p>
		Like the 'width' and 'height' properties, 
		'flex-basis' determines the size of the content box,
		unless otherwise specified
		such as by 'box-sizing' [[CSS3UI]].
	
<h2 id='alignment'>
Alignment</h2>

	<p>
		After a flex container's contents have finished their flexing 
		and the dimensions of all flex items are finalized, 
		they can then be aligned within the flex container.

	<p>
		The 'margin' properties can be used to align items in a manner similar to, but more powerful than, what margins can do in block layout.
		<i>Flex items</i> also respect the alignment properties from the Box Alignment spec,
		which allow easy keyword-based alignment of items in both the <i>main axis</i> and <i>cross axis</i>.
		These properties make many common types of alignment trivial, 
		including some things that were very difficult in CSS 2.1, 
		like horizontal and vertical centering.

	<p class='note'>
		While the alignment properties are defined in the Box Alignment spec,
		Flexbox reproduces the definitions of the relevant ones here
		so as to not create a normative dependency that may slow down advancement of the spec.
		These properties apply only to flex layout
		until Box Alignment is finished
		and defines their effect for other layout modes.


<h3 id='auto-margins'>
Aligning with ''auto'' margins</h3>

	<p>
		<em>This section is non-normative.  
			The normative definition of how margins affect flex items is in the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a> section.</em>

	<p>
		Margins on flex items that are ''auto'' have an effect very similar to auto margins in normal flow:

	<ul>
		<li>
			During calculations of flex bases and flexible lengths, auto margins are treated as ''0''.

		<li>
			Prior to alignment via 'justify-content' and 'align-self',
			any positive free space is distributed to auto margins in that dimension.

		<li>
			Margin-based alignment has no effect on overflowing elements.
	</ul>

	<p class='note'>
		Note that, if free space is distributed to auto margins, 
		the alignment properties will have no effect in that dimension
		because the margins will have stolen all the free space
		left over after flexing.

	<div class="example">
		<p>Auto margins can be used for simple alignment or for fine control.

		<p>Note that auto margins work consistently in both dimensions, so a simple markup like this

		<pre>
div { 
	display: flex;
	width: 4em; 
	height: 4em; 
	background:silver;
}
p { margin:auto; }
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

		<p>will center the single child:
	
		<img alt="image of square OK button" height="82" src="images/OK.png" width="82">
		
		<p>And this

		<pre>
div {
	display: flex;
	width: calc(100% - 4em); 
	height:calc(100% - 4em);
	border: 1em solid blue; 
	border-radius:50%;
	margin: auto;
}
div#demo { width:9em; height:9em; }

&lt;div id="demo">&lt;div>&lt;div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div>&lt;/div></pre>

		<p>
			will produce nested centered boxes:
			<img alt="concentric blue circles" height="191" src="images/target.png" width="210">

<h3 id='box-manip'>
Initial Setup</h3>

	<ol start=0>
		<li id='algo-anon-box'>
			<strong>Generate anonymous flex items</strong> 
			as described in the <a href="#flex-items">Flex Items</a> section.

		<li id='algo-flex-order'>
			<strong>Re-order the flex items according to their 'order'.</strong>
			The items with the lowest (most negative) 'order' values are first in the ordering.  
			If multiple items share a 'order' value, 
			they're ordered by document order.  
			This affects the order in which the flex items generate boxes in the box-tree, 
			and how the rest of this algorithm deals with the items.

<h3 id='line-sizing'>
Line Length Determination</h3>
	
	<ol class=continue>
		<li id='algo-available'>
			<strong>Determine the available main and cross space for the flex items.</strong>
			For each dimension,
			if that dimension of the flex container is a <i>definite size</i>, use that;
			otherwise, subtract the flex container's margin, border, and padding
			from the space available to the flex container in that dimension
			and use that value.
			<span class='note'>This might result in an infinite value.</span>

		<li id='algo-main-item'>
			<strong>Determine the <dfn>flex base size</dfn> and <dfn>hypothetical main size</dfn> of each item:</strong>

			<ul>
				<li>
					If the item has a <i>definite</i> flex basis,
					that's the <i>flex base size</i>.

				<li>
					If the flex basis is ''auto'' or depends on its available size,
					and the flex container is being sized under a min-content or max-content constraint
					(e.g. when performing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#auto-table-layout">automatic table layout</a> [[!CSS21]]),
					size the item under that constraint.
					The <i>flex base size</i> is the item's resulting main size.

				<li>
					Otherwise,
					if the flex basis is ''auto'' or depends on its available size,
					the available main size is infinite,
					and the flex item's inline axis is parallel to the main axis,
					lay the item out using
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#orthogonal-flows">the rules for a box
					in an orthogonal flow</a> [[!CSS3-WRITING-MODES]].
					The <i>flex base size</i> is the item's max-content main size.

				<li>
					Otherwise,
					lay out the item into the available space
					using its flex basis in place of its main size,
					and treating ''auto'' as ''max-content''.
					The <i>flex base size</i> is the item's resulting main size.

			</ul>

			The <i>hypothetical main size</i> is the item's <i>flex base size</i>
			clamped according to its min and max main size properties.

		<li id='algo-main-container'>
			<strong>Determine the main size of the flex container</strong> using its <i>main size property</i>.
			In this calculation, the <i>min content main size</i> of the flex container
			is the maximum of the flex container's items' <i>min-content size contributions</i>,
			and the <i>max content main size</i> of the flex container
			is the sum of the flex container's items' <i>max-content size contributions</i>.
			The min-content/max-content main size contribution of an item is
			its outer <i>hypothetical main size</i>
			when sized under a min-content/max-content constraint (respectively).
			For this computation, ''auto'' margins are treated as ''0''.

Main Size Determination</h3>

		<li id='algo-line-break'>
			<strong>Collect flex items into flex lines:</strong>

			<ul>
				<li>
					If the flex container is single-line, 
					collect all the flex items into a single flex line.

				<li>
					Otherwise,
					starting from the first uncollected item, 
					collect as many consecutive flex items as will fit
					or until a forced break is encountered
					(but collect at least one)
					into the flex container's inner main size into a flex line.
					A break is forced wherever 
					the CSS2.1 'page-break-before/after' [[CSS21]]
					or the CSS3 'break-before/after' [[CSS3-BREAK]] properties 
					specify a fragmentation break.

					<p>
						For this step,
						the size of a flex item is its outer <i>hypothetical main size</i>.

					<p>
						Repeat until all flex items have been collected into flex lines.

					<p class='note'>
						Note that items with zero main size will never start a line
						unless they're the very first items in the flex container,
						or they're preceded by a forced break.
						The "collect as many" line will collect them
						onto the end of the previous line
						even if the last non-zero item exactly "filled up" the line.

			<strong>Determine the used flex ratio.</strong>
			Sum the outer <i>hypothetical main sizes</i> of all items on the line.

					Set the item's main size

					minus a fraction of the free space
					proportional to the ratio.
					<span class="note">Note this may result in a negative inner main size;

			</dl>

		<li>
			<strong>Fix min/max violations.</strong>
			Clamp each item's main size by its min and max main size properties.
			If the item's main size was made smaller by this, it's a max violation.
			If the item's main size was made larger by this, it's a min violation.

<h2 id="pagination">
Fragmenting Flex Layout</h2>

	<p>
		Flex containers can break across pages
		between items, 
		between lines of items (in multi-line mode),
		and inside items.
		The 'break-*' properties apply to flex containers as normal for block-level or inline-level boxes.
		This section defines how they apply to flex items
		and elements inside flex items.

	<p>
		The following breaking rules refer to the fragmentation container as the “page”. 
		The same rules apply to any other fragmenters.
		(Substitute “page” with the appropriate fragmenter type as needed.)
		See the CSS3 Fragmentation Module [[!CSS3-BREAK]].
		For readability, in this section the terms "row" and "column" refer to the relative orientation
		of the flex container with respect to the block flow direction of the fragmentation context,
		rather than to that of the flex container itself.

	<p>
		The exact layout of a fragmented flex container is not defined in this level of Flexible Box Layout.
		However, breaks inside a flex container are subject to the following rules:

	<ul>
		<li>
			In a row flex container,
			the 'break-before' and 'break-after' properties on flex items
			are propagated to the flex line.
			The 'break-before' property on the first line
			and the 'break-after' property on the last line
			are propagated to the flex container.

		<li>
			In a column flex container,
			the 'break-before' property on the first item
			and the 'break-after' property on the last item
			are propagated to the flex container.
			Forced breaks on other items are applied to the item itself.

		<li>
			A forced break inside a flex item effectively increases the size of its contents;
			it does not trigger a forced break inside sibling items.

		<li>
			In a row flex container, 
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#btw-blocks">Class 1 break opportunities</a> occur between sibling flex lines,
			and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#end-block">Class 3 break opportunities</a> occur between the first/last flex line and the flex container's content edges.
			In a column flex container, 
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#btw-blocks">Class 1 break opportunities</a> occur between sibling flex items,
			and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#end-block">Class 3 break opportunities</a> occur between the first/last flex items on a line and the flex container's content edges.
			[[!CSS3-BREAK]]
		
		<li>
			When a flex container is continued after a break, 
			the space available to its <i>flex items</i> 
			(in the block flow direction of the fragmentation context)
			is reduced by the space consumed by flex container fragments on previous pages. 
			The space consumed by a flex container fragment is
			the size of its content box on that page.
			If as a result of this adjustment the available space becomes negative, 
			it is set to zero.

		<li>
			If the first fragment of the flex container is not at the top of the page,
			and some of its flex items don't fit in the remaining space on the page,
			the entire fragment is moved to the next page.

		<li>
			When a <i>multi-line</i> colum flex container breaks,
			each fragment has its own "stack" of flex lines,
			just like each fragment of a multi-column element
			has its own row of column boxes.

		<li>
			Aside from the rearrangement of items imposed by the previous point,
			UAs should attempt to minimize distortation of the flex container
			with respect to unfragmented flow.
	</ul>


<h3 id='pagination-algo'>
Sample Flex Fragmentation Algorithm</h3>

	<p>
		This informative section presents a possible fragmentation algorithm for flex containers.
		UAs are encouraged to improve on this algorithm and <a href='#status'>provide feedback to the CSS Working Group</a>.

<div class='example'>

	<p class='note'>
		This algorithm assumes that pagination always proceeds only in the forward direction;
		therefore, in the algorithms below, alignment is mostly ignored prior to pagination.
		Advanced layout engines may be able to honor alignment across fragments.

	<dl>
		<dt>Single-line column flex container
		<dd>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Run the flex layout algorithm (without regards to pagination)
					through <a href="#cross-sizing">Cross Sizing Determination</a>.

				<li>
					Lay out as many consecutive flex items or item fragments as possible 
					(but at least one or a fragment thereof), 
					starting from the first, 
					until there is no more room on the page
					or a forced break is encountered.

				<li>
					If the previous step ran out of room 
					and the free space is positive,
					the UA may reduce the distributed free space on this page 
					(down to, but not past, zero) 
					in order to make room for the next unbreakable flex item or fragment. 
					Otherwise, 
					the item or fragment that does not fit is pushed to the next page. 
					The UA should pull up if more than 50% of the fragment would have fit in the remaining space 
					and should push otherwise.

				<li>
					If there are any flex items or fragments not laid out by the previous steps,
					rerun the flex layout algorithm 
					from <a href="#line-sizing">Line Length Determination</a>
					through <a href="#cross-sizing">Cross Sizing Determination</a>
					with the next page's size
					and <em>all</em> the contents (including those already laid out),
					and return to the previous step,
					but starting from the first item or fragment not already laid out.

				<li>
					For each fragment of the flex container,
					continue the flex layout algorithm
					from <a href="#main-alignment">Main-Axis Alignment</a>
					to its finish.
			</ol>

			<p class="note">
				It is the intent of this algorithm that column-direction single-line flex containers
				paginate very similarly to block flow. 
				As a test of the intent, 
				a flex container with ''justify-content:start''
				and no flexible items 
				should paginate identically to 
				a block with in-flow children with same content, 
				same used size and same used margins.

Document conventions</h3>

  <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of

  <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
  explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]
  
  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”

  <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Flexible Box Layout Module
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>
  
  <p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Flexible Box Layout Module
  if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
  according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
  feature defined in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Flexible Box Layout Module
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by CSS Flexible Box Layout Module by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Flexible Box Layout Module
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.
  
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
  
  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  
 
<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementers should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
  
  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.
  
  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR exit criteria</h3>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>
  
  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.

	<p>
		The following major changes were made since the
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-flexbox-20120322/">22 March 2012 Working Draft</a>:
	<ul>
		<li>
			The 'display' values for flex containers have been changed
			from ''flexbox'' and ''inline-flexbox'' to ‘<a href="#display-flex"><code class=css>flex</code></a>’ and ''inline-flex''.
		<li>
			The alignment properties and values have been renamed to align with the new
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-align/">Box Alignment</a> module:
			<ul>
				<li>'flex-align' &rarr; 'align-items'
				<li>'flex-item-align' &rarr; 'align-self'
				<li>'flex-line-pack' &rarr; 'align-content'
				<li>'flex-pack' &rarr; 'justify-content'
			</ul>
		<li>
			The 'flex-order' property has been renamed to 'order',
			to allow it to be used with other layout models in the future.
		<li>
			The 'flex' shorthand has been split into the 'flex-grow', 'flex-shrink', and 'flex-basis' longhands.
		<li>
			Negative free space is now distributed in proportion to <var>flex base size</var> &times; <var>flex shrink ratio</var>,
			rather than just the flex shrink ratio.
		<li>
			Flex items are now allowed to shrink by default. (The initial value of 'flex-shrink' is ''1''.)
		<li>
			A new <a href="#min-size-auto">''auto'' value for 'min-width/height'</a> has been added
			to set a reasonable default minimum main size for flex items.
		<li>
			The <a href="#visibility-collapse">effect of ''visibility: collapse''</a>
			on flex items is now defined.
		<li>
			Inline replaced elements are no longer promoted to flex items;
			instead certain HTML elements intended to be replaced elements are promoted to flex items.
			This produces a consistent layout model regardless of whether the replaced content can be loaded.
		<li>
			For <a href="#pagination">pagination</a>, the effect and propagation of
			page-breaking controls has been tweaked and clarified,
			and most of the details of fragmentation are now informative,
			allowing UAs to do better.
		<li>
			The flex layout algorithm has received an editorial overhaul,
			and many error fixes and clarifications were made.
		<li>
			A lot of terminology has been updated to make it less confusing:
			<ul>
				<li>flexbox &rarr; flex container
				<li>flexbox item &rarr; flex item
				<li>positive flexibility &rarr; flex grow ratio
				<li>negative flexibility &rarr; flex shrink ratio
				<li>preferred size &rarr; flex basis
				<li>hypothetical main size &rarr; flex base size
			</ul>
	</ul>
