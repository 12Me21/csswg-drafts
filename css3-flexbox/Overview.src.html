Abstract</h2>

	<p>The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flexbox layout model, the children of a flexbox can be laid out in any direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent.  Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.</p>

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes &mdash; algorithms which determine the size and position of boxes based on their relationships with their sibling and ancestor boxes: block layout, designed for laying out documents; inline layout, designed for laying out text; table layout, designed for laying out information in a tabular format; and positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard for other elements in the document. This module introduces a new layout mode, flexbox layout, which is designed for laying out more complex applications and webpages.</p>

	<p>Flexbox layout is superficially similar to block layout.  It lacks many of the more complex text or document-formatting properties that can be used in block layout, such as 'float' and 'columns', but in return it gains more simple and powerful tools for aligning its contents in ways that webapps and complex web pages often need.  </p>

    <p>The contents of a flexbox can be laid out in any direction (left, right, down, or even up!), can have their order swapped around dynamically (i.e., display order is independent of source order), and can "flex" their sizes and positions to respond to the available space.  If a flexbox is <i>multi-line</i>, the flexbox items flow in two dimensions, wrapping into separate lines in a fashion similar to how text is wrapped into multiple lines.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>For example, the following HTML snippet uses flexbox to create a toolbar with icons.  The flexbox is horizontal, and the children's widths don't fill the flexbox's width, so the additional space is distributed around and between the children.  As the flexbox grows (perhaps because the user is viewing the page on a wider screen), the children spread out evenly and automatically:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;button>&lt;img src='new.svg' alt="New">&lt;/button>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;button>&lt;img src='upload.svg' alt="Upload">&lt;/button>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;button>&lt;img src='save.svg' alt="Save">&lt;/button>&lt;/li>
  &lt;li>&lt;button>&lt;img src='trash.svg' alt="trash">&lt;/button>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;style>
ul { display: flexbox; flex-pack: distribute; }
/* Irrelevant styling for this example removed. */
&lt;/style></pre>

		<div class='figure'>
			<img src="images/toolbar-example.svg" width=400 height=140>
			<p class='caption'>Example rendering of the above code snippet, at two different flexbox widths.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

<h3 id="placement">
Module interactions</h3>

	<p>This module extends the definition of the 'display' property.  It also defines a new type of primitive value, the <a href="#flex-function">flex() notation</a>, which is accepted by the 'width' and 'height' properties.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]]. Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>

	<p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties defined in this specification also accept the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">''inherit''</a> keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id='box-model'>
The Flexbox Box Model</h2>

	<p>An element with ''display:flexbox'' or ''display:inline-flexbox'' is a <dfn>flexbox</dfn>.  Children of a flexbox are called <dfn title="flexbox item|flexbox items|flexbox item's" id="flexbox-item">flexbox items</dfn> and are laid out using the flexbox box model.</p>

	<p>Unlike block layout, which is normally biased towards laying things out vertically, and inline layout, which is normally biased toward laying things out horizontally, the flexbox layout algorithm is agnostic as to the direction the flexbox happens to be laid out in.  To make it easier to talk about flexbox layout in a general way, we will define several direction-agnostic terms here to make the rest of the spec easier to read and understand.</p>

	<div class='figure'>
		<img src='images/flex-direction-terms.svg' width=510 height=300>
		<p class='caption'>An illustration of the various directions and sizing terms used in this specification, respectively for ''row'' and ''column'' flexboxes.</p>
	</div>

	<p>The <dfn>main axis</dfn> of a flexbox is the axis on which <i>flexbox items</i> are laid out along.  The <i>flexbox items</i> are ordered such that they start on the <dfn>main-start</dfn> side of the flexbox, and go toward the <dfn>main-end</dfn> side.  A <i>flexbox item's</i> width or height, whichever is in the <i>main axis</i>, is the item's <dfn>main size</dfn>.  The <i>flexbox item's</i> <dfn>main size property</dfn> is either the 'width' or 'height' property, whichever is in the <i>main axis</i>.</p>

	<p>The axis perpendicular to the <i>main axis</i> is called the <dfn>cross axis</dfn>, and similarly has <dfn>cross-start</dfn> and <dfn>cross-end</dfn> directions and sides defined.  The width or height of a <i>flexbox item</i>, whichever is in the <i>cross axis</i>, is the item's <dfn>cross size</dfn>, and similarly the <dfn>cross size property</dfn> is whichever of 'width' or 'height' that is in the <i>cross axis</i>.</p>

	<p>The contents of a flexbox can be easily and powerfully manipulated with a handful of properties.  Most significantly, <i>flexbox items</i> can "flex" their <i>main size</i> by using the ''flex()'' function in the 'width' or 'height' property.  This "flexing" allows the items to get bigger or smaller based on the available space in the page.  If there is leftover space in the flexbox after all of the <i>flexbox items</i> have finished flexing, the items can be aligned, centered, or distributed with the 'flex-pack' property.  <i>Flexbox items</i> can also be completely rearranged within the flexbox with the 'flex-order' property.</p>

	<p>In the <i>cross axis</i>, <i>flexbox items</i> can either "flex" to fill the available space or be aligned within the space with the 'flex-align' property.  If a flexbox is <i>multi-line</i>, new lines are added in the <i>cross-end</i> direction, and can similarly be aligned, centered, or distributed within the flexbox with the 'flex-line-pack' property.</p>


<h3 id='display-flexbox'>
New values for 'display' property</h3>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td>display
		<tr>
			<th><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-module/#values">New value</a>:
			<td>flexbox | inline-flexbox
	</table>

	<p>You can declare that an element is a flexbox, and thus should use flexbox layout for its contents, by setting the 'display' property on the element to the value 'flexbox' or 'inline-flexbox'.</p>

	<p>The ''flexbox'' value makes the flexbox a block-level element.  The ''inline-flexbox'' value makes the flexbox an inline-level element.  When it is necessary to distinguish them, this specification will refer to the former kind of flexbox as a <dfn id="block-flexbox" title="block flexbox|block flexboxes">block flexbox</dfn> and the latter type as an <dfn id="inline-flexbox" title="inline flexbox|inline flexboxes">inline flexbox</dfn>.</p>

	<p>Flexboxes use a new layout algorithm, and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of block layout don't make sense in a flexbox context.  In particular:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module have no effect on a flexbox.</li>

		<li>'float' and 'clear' have no effect on a flexbox item.  Using 'float' on an element still causes that element's 'display' property to compute to ''block'', as normal, because that occurs before flexbox items are determined (the algorithm for wrapping children of a flexbox into <i>flexbox items</i> needs the computed value of 'display').</li>

		<li>'vertical-align' has no effect on the alignment of a flexbox item in the flexbox</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If an element's specified value for 'display' is ''inline-flexbox'' and the element is floated or absolutely positioned, the computed value of 'display' must be ''flexbox''.</p>

	<p>A flexbox establishes a new <dfn>flexbox formatting context</dfn> for its contents.  This is similar to a block formatting context root: floats do not intrude into the flexbox, and the flexbox's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents.  Additionally, each of the <i>flexbox items</i> establish a new formatting context for its contents.</p>


<h3 id='flex-items'>
Flexbox Items</h3>

	<p class='issue'>Add a ''display:flexbox-item'' value, so I can do flexbox-fixup (wrapping an anonymous flexbox around children that have declared themselves to be items).</p>

	<p>Flexbox layout algorithm operates on <i>flexbox items</i>, which are boxes that satisfy at least one of the following criteria:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Immediate block-level children of flexbox</li>

		<li>Atomic inline-level children of flexbox</li>

		<li>Contiguous run of non-replaced inline children, wrapped into an anonymous box</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Some values of 'display' trigger "fixup" to ensure a sensible tree structure.  For example, a lone ''table-cell'' box is fixed up by generating ''table'', ''table-row-group'', and ''table-row'' boxes around it.  This fixup must occur <em>before</em> a flexbox's contents are checked to see if it's necessary to generate anonymous flexbox items.</p>

	<p class='note'>In the future, other kinds of fixup such as ''display:run-in'' or ''display:ruby'' should also run before flexbox fixup.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>Examples of flexbox items:</p>
		<pre>
&lt;div style="display:flexbox">

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level child -->
    &lt;div id="item1">block&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- not a flexbox item, because it's out-of-flow -->
    &lt;div id="not-an-item1.5" style="position: absolute;">block&lt;/div>
    
    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level child -->
    &lt;div id="item2" style="display:table">table&lt;/div>
    
    &lt;!-- flexbox item: anonymous table wrapped around table-cell -->
    &lt;div id="item3" style="display:table-cell">table-cell&lt;/div> 

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: anonymous block around inline content -->
    anonymous item 4

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level child -->
    &lt;div id="item5">block&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: anonymous block around inline content -->
    anonymous item 6.1
    &lt;span id="item6.1">
        text 6.2
        &lt;div id="not-an-item6.3">block&lt;/div>
        text 6.4
    &lt;/span>

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: block-level replaced element -->
    &lt;iframe id="item7"></iframe>

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: inline-level replaced element -->
    &lt;img id="item7" style="display:inline">

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: inline-level replaced element -->
    &lt;button id="item8">button&lt;/button>

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: inline-table -->
    &lt;div id="item9" style="display:inline-table">table&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- flexbox item: floated inline, which changes to a block -->
    &lt;span id="item10" style="float: left;">span&lt;/span>
&lt;/div></pre>

		<p>Notice that block element "not-an-item6.3" is not a separate flexbox item, because it is contained inside an inline element which is being wrapped into an anonymous flex item.  Similarly, the block element "not-an-item1.5" is not a flexbox item, because it's absolutely positioned and thus out of flow.</p>
	</div>

<h4 id='abspos-flexbox-items'>
Positioning Absolutely Positioned Flexbox Items</h4>

	<p>Absolutely positioned children of a flexbox are not <i>flexbox items</i>, but they leave behind "placeholders" in their normal position in the box tree.  These placeholders are anonymous inline boxes with a width and height of ''0px'', and they interact normally with the flexbox layout algorithm.  In particular, they'll trigger the creation an anonymous flexbox item wrapper boxes, or join neighboring inline elements in <em>their</em> anonymous flexbox item wrapper boxes.</p>

	<p>The "static position" of an absolutely positioned child of a flexbox (the position when the 'top'/'right'/'bottom'/'left' properties are ''auto''), then, is the final position of their corresponding placeholder, after flexbox layout has been performed.</p>

	<p class='note'>Note: In most cases, this means that absolutely positioned items will have no effect on flexbox layout, even if they force the generation of an anonymous flexbox item wrapper, because those wrapper items will also collapse to zero size and have no effect.  The only exception is when the flexbox has ''flex-pack:justify'', in which case the anonymous flexbox item will cause there to be two packing spaces where there would otherwise be only one, which will appear as a double-size space between two "real" items.</p>

<h2 id='ordering-orientation'>
Ordering and Orientation</h2>

	<p>The first level of flexbox functionality is the ability to lay out a flexbox's contents in any direction and in any order.  This allows an author to trivially achieve effects that would previously have required complex or fragile methods, such as using the 'float' property to lay out a horizontal navigation bar (which then requires further effort with the 'clear' property or others to make the elements interact nicely with the rest of the page).  This functionality is exposed through the 'flex-flow' and 'flex-order' properties.</p>

<h3 id='flex-direction'>
Flexbox Flow Direction: the 'flex-direction' property</h3>

	<p>The 'flex-direction' property specifies how <i>flexbox items</i> are placed in the flexbox, by setting the direction of the flexbox's <i>main axis</i>.  This affects the direction that flexbox items are laid out in, and the meaning of the 'flex-pack' property.</p>

	<p>The 'flex-wrap' property controls whether the flexbox is <i>single-line</i> or <i>multi-line</i>, and the direction of the <i>cross axis</i>, which affects the direction new lines are stacked in and the meaning of the 'flex-align', 'flex-item-align', and 'flex-line-pack' properties.</p>

	<p>The 'flex-flow' property is a shorthand for setting the 'flex-direction' and 'flex-wrap' properties together.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>Some examples of valid flows:</p>

		<table style="margin: 0 auto; vertical-align: middle; border-spacing: 2em 1em;">

		</table>
	</div>


<h3 id='flex-order'>
Display Order: the 'flex-order' property</h3>

	<p><i>Flexbox items</i> are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the source document.  The 'flex-order' property may be used to change this ordering.</p>

	<table class=propdef>
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>flex-order</dfn>

		<tr>
			<th>Computed value:
			<td>specified value
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Animatable:
			<td>yes
	</table>

	<p>The 'flex-order' property assigns <i>flexbox items</i> to ordinal groups.</p>

	<p>Ordinal groups control the order in which <i>flexbox items</i> appear.  A flexbox will lay out its content starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and going up.  Items with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they appear in the source document.  'flex-order' has no effect on stacking/layering; elements must still be drawn over/under each other based on document order, 'z-index', and other relevant means.</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>The following figure shows a simple tabbed interface, where the tab for the active pane is always in front:</p>

		<div class='figure'><img src="images/flex-order-example.png"></div>

		<p>This could be implemented with the following CSS (showing only the flexbox-relevant code):</p>

		<pre>
.tabs {
	display: flexbox;
}
.tabs > .current {
	flex-order: -1; /* Lower than the default of 0 */
}</pre>

		<p>You can also see a <a href="flex-order-example.html">working example</a> in some modern browsers (modern WebKit, Firefox, or any browser that supports the Flexbox spec).</p>
	</div>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>Many web pages have a similar shape in the markup, with a header on top, a footer on bottom, and then a content area and one or two additional columns in the middle.  Generally, it's desirable that the content come first in the page's source code, before the additional columns.  However, this makes many common designs, such as simply having the additional columns on the left and the content area on the right, difficult to achieve.  This has been addressed in many ways over the years, often going by the name "Holy Grail Layout" when there are two additional columns.  'flex-order' makes this trivial.  For example, take the following sketch of a page's code and desired layout:</p>

		<div class='code-and-figure'>
			<div><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;header>...&lt;/header>
&lt;div id='main'>
   &lt;article>...&lt;/article>
   &lt;nav>...&lt;/nav>
   &lt;aside>...&lt;/aside>
&lt;/div>

		<p>This layout can be easily achieved with Flexbox:</p>

		<pre>
#main { display: flexbox; }
#main > article { width: flex(1); flex-order: 2; }
#main > nav     { width: 200px;   flex-order: 1; }
#main > aside   { width: 200px;   flex-order: 3; }</pre>
		
		<p>As an added bonus, the columns will all be equal-height by default, and the main content will be as wide as necessary to fill the screen.  Additionally, this can then be combined with media queries to switch to an all-vertical layout on narrow screens:</p>

		<pre>
@media all and (max-width: 600px) {
	/* Too narrow to support three columns */
	#main { flex-flow: column; }
	#main > article, #main > nav, #main > aside {
		/* Return them to document order */
		flex-order: 0; width: auto;
	}
}</pre>

		<p><small>(Further use of multiline flexboxes to achieve even more intelligent wrapping left as an exercise for the reader.)</small></p>

<h2 id='flexibility'>
Flexibility: the ''flex()'' notation</h2>

	<p>The defining aspect of flexbox layout is the ability to make the <i>flexbox items</i> "flex", altering their width or height to fill the available space.  This is done by using a ''&lt;flex>'' value in the element's 'width' or 'height' property.  A flexbox distributes free space to its items proportional to their positive flexibility, or shrinks them to prevent overflow proportional to their negative flexibility.</p>

	<p>The ''flex()'' notation is used to specify the parameters of a <dfn title="flexible length|flexible lengths|flexible length's">flexible length</dfn>: the <dfn id="positive-flexibility" title="positive flexibility">positive</dfn> and <dfn>negative flexibility</dfn>, and the <dfn>preferred size</dfn>.  The syntax of the ''flex()'' notation is:</p>

	<pre class=prod><dfn>&lt;flex></dfn> = flex( [ &lt;pos-flex> &lt;neg-flex>? ]? &amp;&amp; &lt;preferred-size>? )</pre>

	<p><code>&lt;pos-flex></code> and <code>&lt;neg-flex></code> are non-negative <code>&lt;numbers>s</code>, while <code>&lt;preferred-size></code> is any value (other than another ''&lt;flex>'') that would be valid in the 'width' or 'height' property in which the notation is used.  If the <code>&lt;preferred-size></code> is ''0'', it <strong>must</strong> be specified with a unit (like ''0px'') to avoid ambiguity; unitless zero will either be interpreted as as one of the flexibilities, or is a syntax error.</p>

	<p>The <code>&lt;pos-flex></code> component sets the length's <i>positive flexibility</i>; if omitted, the <i>positive flexibility</i> defaults to ''1''.  The <code>&lt;neg-flex></code> component sets the length's <i>negative flexibility</i>; if omitted, it defaults to ''0''.  The <code>&lt;preferred-size></code> component sets the length's <i>preferred size</i>; if omitted, it defaults to ''0px''.</p>

	<p>If the ''flex()'' notation is specified on an element that is not a <i>flexbox item</i>, it computes to the <i>preferred size</i>.  If the ''flex()'' notation is used on a <i>flexbox item's</i> <i>cross size property</i>, it computes to the <i>preferred size</i>.  Otherwise, it computes to itself, and is resolved to a length at used-value time by the flexbox layout algorithm.</p>

	<p>A ''&lt;flex>'' value is transitionable, by transitioning the <i>preferred size</i>, <i>positive flexibility</i>, and <i>negative flexibility</i> independently.  ''&lt;flex>'' can also transition to and from a &lt;length>, by treating the length as if it were a flexible length with a positive and negative flexibility of zero and a preferred size of the length.</p>

	<p class='issue'>Transitioning to/from a &lt;length> (or to/from a &lt;flex> with 0 flexibility) doesn't work well if it's the only flexible item in the flexbox.  Rather than smoothly transitioning, it suddenly jumps in size when the flexibility becomes non-zero.  Can we fix this, perhaps with a value that represents a percentage of the free space or something?</p>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>The ''flex()'' notation allows elements to respond directly to the available space, in ways that are difficult or impossible in normal CSS.  One common example is a page with one segment intended to stay on screen, and another section which may be long but which shouldn't scroll the page, like a chat room:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;body>
  &lt;header>Channel: #csswg  Topic: CSS IS AWE    SOME&lt;/header>
  &lt;article id='messages'>
  	&lt;p>&lt;b>Tab Atkins:&lt;/b> 
  	  I think the layout algorithm is done.&lt;/p>
  	&lt;p>&lt;b>Fantasai:&lt;/b> 
  	  SUBMIT BEFORE ZOD.&lt;/p>
  	...
  &lt;/article>
  &lt;form>
  	&lt;input name='message'>
  	&lt;button type='submit'>Send&lt;/button>
  &lt;/form>
 &lt;/body>
 &lt;style>
 body { display:flexbox; flex-flow: column; }
 #messages { height: flex(1); }
 &lt;/style></pre>

<h2 id='alignment'>
Alignment</h2>

	<p>After a flexbox's contents have finished their flexing, they can be aligned in both the <i>main axis</i> with 'flex-pack' and the <i>cross axis</i> with 'flex-align' and 'flex-item-align'.  These properties make many common types of alignment trivial, including some things that were very difficult in CSS 2.1, like horizontal and vertical centering.</p>

	<p>The 'flex-pack' property aligns <i>flexbox items</i> in the <i>main axis</i> of the current line of the flexbox.  This is done <em title=''>after</em> any flexible lengths have been resolved.  Typically it helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the <i>flexbox items</i> on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reach their maximum size, but it also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>

		<dd><i>Flexbox items</i> are packed toward the center of the line.

	<p><i>Flexbox items</i> can be aligned in the <i>cross axis</i> of the current line of the flexbox, similar to 'flex-pack' but in the perpendicular direction.  'flex-align' sets the default alignment for all of the flexbox's <i title="flexbox items">items</i>, including anonymous <i>flexbox items</i>.  'flex-item-align' allows this default alignment to be overridden for individual <i>flexbox items</i> (for anonymous flexbox items, 'flex-item-align' always matches the value of 'flex-align' on their associated flexbox).</p>

	<p>A value of <dfn id="flex-item-align-auto">''auto''</dfn> for 'flex-item-align' computes to the value of 'flex-align' on the <i>flexbox item's</i> flexbox.  The alignments are defined as:</p>

		</div>
	</div>


<h2 id='multi-line'>
Multi-line Flexbox</h2>

	<p>A flexbox can be either <i>single-line</i> or <i>multi-line</i>, depending on the 'flex-wrap' property.  A <dfn>single-line</dfn> flexbox lays out all of its children in a single line, even if that would cause the flexbox to overflow its bounds.  A <dfn>multi-line</dfn> flexbox breaks its <i>flexbox items</i> across multiple lines to avoid overflowing, similar to how text is broken onto a new line when it gets too wide to fit on the existing line.  Every line contains at least one <i>flexbox item</i>, unless the flexbox itself is completely empty.</p>

	<p>When additional lines are created, they are stacked in the flexbox in the <i>cross axis</i>.  Each line is completely independent; flexible lengths and the 'flex-pack' and 'flex-align' properties only consider the items on a single line at a time.  The <i>main size</i> of a line is the same as the <i>main size</i> of the flexbox's content box.  The <i>cross size</i> of a line depends on whether the flexbox is <i>single-line</i> or <i>multi-line</i>: the <i>cross size</i> of the sole line in a <i>single-line</i> flexbox is the same as the <i>cross size</i> of the flexbox's content box, while the <i>cross size</i> of a line in a <i>multi-line</i> flexbox is the minimum size necessary to contain the <i>flexbox items</i> on the line, after aligning them with 'flex-align'.  The lines themselves are then aligned within a flexbox with the 'flex-line-pack' property.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p>This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally.</p>

		<pre>&lt;style>
#div1 {
	display: flexbox;
	flex-flow: row wrap;
	width: 300px;
}
button {
	width: flex(80px 1);
}
&lt;style>

&lt;div id="div1">
	&lt;button id="button1">Elephant&lt;/button>
	&lt;button id="button2">Tiger&lt;/button>
	&lt;button id="button3">Antelope&lt;/button>
	&lt;button id="button4">Wildebeest&lt;/button>
&lt;/div></pre>

		<p>The buttons are first set to their preferred widths, in this case 80 pixels. This will allow the first three buttons to fit in 240 pixels with 60 pixels left over of remaining space. Because the 'flex-flow' property specifies a multi-line flexbox (due to the ''wrap'' keyword appearing in its value), the flexbox will create an additional line to contain the last button.</p>

		<p>Flexibility is applied to each element, separately for each line. The first line has 60 pixels of remaining space and all of the buttons have the same flexibility, so each of the three buttons on that line will receive 20 pixels of extra width, ending up 100px wide. The remaining button is on a line of its own and will stretch to the entire width of the line, or 300 pixels.</p>

		<div style="width:300px; border:medium solid green; overflow: hidden;">
			<button style="width:100px; float: left;">Elephant</button>
			<button style="width:100px; float: left;">Tiger</button>
			<button style="width:100px; float: left;">Antelope</button>
			<button style="width:300px; float: left;">Wildebeest</button>
		</div>

		<p>If the box was resized, the buttons may rearrange onto different lines as necessary.</p>
		
		<p>If the style rules in the example above were changed to the following:</p>

		<pre>
#div1 {
	display: flexbox;
	flex-flow: row wrap;
	flex-pack: center;
	width: 300px;
}
button {
	width: flex(80px 1);
	max-width: 90px;
}</pre>

		<p>Similar to the previous example, the first three buttons will fit on the first line, and the last button will wrap onto a new line.  However, when the buttons attempt to flex they can only grow to 90px each, due to their 'max-width' property.  This leaves 30px of free space on the first line and 210px of free space on the second line.  Because 'flex-pack' is set to ''center'', the buttons will be centered on each line, with the free space split equally on either side.</p>

		<div style="width:300px; border:medium solid green; text-align:center;">
			<button style="width:90px; float: left; margin-left: 15px;">Elephant</button>
			<button style="width:90px; float: left;">Tiger</button>
			<button style="width:90px; float: left;">Antelope</button>
			<button style="width:90px">Wildebeest</button>

<h2 id='layout-algorithm'>
Flexbox Layout Algorithm</h2>

	<p>This section contains normative algorithms detailing the exact layout behavior of a flexbox and its contents.  The algorithms here were designed to optimize readability and theoretical simplicity, and may not necessarily be the most efficient.  Implementations may use whatever actual algorithms they wish, but must produce the same results as the algorithms described here.</p>

	<div class=note>
		<p>This note will outline the general structure of the layout algorithm, before I go into the ugly details below, to aid in reading the relatively-long and complex algorithm.</p>

		<ol>
			<li value=0>Generate anonymous flexbox items as necessary.</li>

			<li>Reorder flexbox items according to 'flex-order'.</li>

			<li>Find the hypothetical main size of every flexbox item.</li>

			<li>Align in the main axis, per 'flex-pack'.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p>This section is mainly intended for implementors.  Authors writing web pages should generally be served well by the individual property descriptions, and do not need to read this section unless they have a deep-seated urge to understand arcane details of CSS layout.</p>

	<p>To lay out a flexbox and its contents, follow these steps:</p>

	<ol>
		<li value=0>Generate anonymous flexbox items around runs of continguous inline content in the flexbox, as described in the <a href="#flex-items">Flexbox Items</a> section.</li>

		<li>Re-order the flexbox items according to their 'flex-order'.  The items with the lowest (most negative) 'flex-order' values are first in the ordering.  If multiple items share a 'flex-order' value, they're ordered by document order.  This affects the order in which the flexbox items generate boxes in the box-tree, and how the rest of this algorithm deals with the items.</li>

		<li>Determine the hypothetical main size of items
			<ol>
				<li>If item has a definite preferred size, it is the hypothetical main size.
				</li>
				<li><p>Otherwise layout the flexbox items 
					using the shrink-to-fit algorithm. 
					<p>Calculation of the shrink-to-fit width is similar to 
					calculating the width of a table cell using the automatic 
					table layout algorithm. Roughly: calculate the preferred 
					width by formatting the content without breaking lines other 
					than where explicit line breaks occur, and also calculate 
					the preferred minimum width, e.g., by trying all possible 
					line breaks. This module doesn&#39;t define the exact algorith, 
					but it is expected that the shrink-to-fit size is calculated 
					the same way as it is for floats, except in this case it is 
					not affected by available space.</p>
				
					<p class="issue">The above definition of shrink-to-fit is 
					copied from CSS2.1 (section 10.3.5: Floats). CSS3 basic box 
					model currently has same text as well. Any suggestions for a 
					better definition?</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><em>Do not apply min/max-width/height constraints to the preferred size of 
					flexible lengths - those constraints are handled elsewhere in this 
					algorithm, and doing so will produce incorrect results.
			</em>
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>If the flexbox is single-line, collect all the flexbox items into a single flexbox line.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>If the flexbox is multi-line, group the flexbox items into multiple lines:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>Determine the maximum line length, based on the main size of the flexbox. The maximum line length is main size of the flexbox's content box, constrained by the min and max main size constraints of the flexbox.  If the main size depends on the flexbox's content, then:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>for ''min-content'', the maximum line length is the flexbox's minimum main size, constrained by the min and max main size constraints of the flexbox.</li>

						<li>for ''max-content'', the maximum line length is infinity, constrained by the min and max main size constraints of the flexbox.</li>

						<li>for ''fit-content'', the maximum line length is the greater of the flexbox's min size constraint and the smaller of the flexbox's max size constraint and the available space.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>Collect as many consecutive flexbox items as possible, starting from the first item, while keeping the sum of their main size smaller than the flexbox's available space.  If a flexbox item is sized with a flexible length, then for the purpose of this step, clamp the item's size between its minimum and maximum main sizes.  The items so collected form a single flexbox line.</li>

				<li>Repeat the previous step, starting each time from the first flexbox item not yet collected into a flexbox line, until all flexbox items have been collected into flexbox lines.</li>

		</li>

		<li>Find the actual main size of the flexbox.  If the flexbox's main size doesn't rely on its contents, its actual main size is calculated per the appropriate rules.  Otherwise, its main size is the length of its longest line, calculated by summing the main sizes of the margin boxes of each flexbox item in the line, constrained by the flexbox's min and max main size constraints.</li>

		<li>For each flexbox line, <i>resolve the flexible lengths</i> of the items contained within it.  All flexbox items now have a final main size.  Update each item's hypothetical cross size based on this main size.</li>

				<li>If main axis is parallel to inline axis, collect all the flexbox 
					items with a 'flex-item-align' of 'baseline'. 
					Find the maximum of the distances

					of their margin box. Sum these two values.

				<li>For remaining flexbox items, find the maximum of the cross sizes of their margin boxes.

				<li>The cross size of the flexbox line is the larger of the numbers found in the previous two steps.</li>
			</ol>

			<p>If the flexbox doesn't have a definite cross size, the cross size of its content box is the sum of the cross sizes of all of its lines.</p>
		</li>

		<li>Determine the final cross size of each flexbox item.  For each flexbox item, if it has ''flex-item-align:stretch'', its final cross size is the cross size of its flexbox line.  For all other flexbox items, its final cross size is its hypothetical cross size.</li>

		<li>For each flexbox line, align the flexbox items per 'flex-item-align'.</li>

		<li>Align the flexbox lines per 'flex-line-pack'.  The leftover free-space is calculated by subtracting the sum of the flexbox line's cross sizes from the cross size of the flexbox's content box.</li>

<h2 id="pagination">Page breaks in flexbox</h2>

<p>Flexboxes can break
across pages between items, between lines of items (in multi-line mode) and
inside items, as long as 'break-' property allow that. All 'break-' properties
are supported on flexbox, on flexbox items and inside flexbox items.</p>

<p>The following breaking rules refer to fragmentation
container as “page”. The same rules apply to any other fragmenters. Change
“page” to the appropriate fragmenter type as needed.</p>

<p>Breaks in and around
flexbox are determined as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
Break-before, break-after,
break-inside properties on flexbox itself have effect as normal. If breaks
inside flexbox are allowed, break points are determined using following rules.</li>

<li>When flexbox is continued
after a break, flexbox’s available space in block direction is reduced by space
consumed in previous pages. Consumed space before page break is

<ol>
<li>If flexbox starts on that
page: the distance between start of content box of the flexbox and the end of
available space</li>

<li>If flexbox continues from
previous page: the size of available space.</li>
</ol>

<p>If as a result of this adjustment block-direction size of flexbox
becomes negative, it is set to zero.</p>
</li>
	<li><dfn>Forced breaks on flexbox items</dfn>
	<ol>
		<li>In a row-direction single-line 
			flexbox, breaks before and after items apply to the flexbox</li>
		<li>In column-directon single-line flexbox and all multi-line flexboxes
			<ol>
				<li>Forced break before the first item is applied to the flexbox</li>
				<li>Forced break after the last item is applied to the flexbox</li>
				<li>Forced break before or after any other item terminates the set of items to be laid out on this page</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="issue">
		There are other options for forced breaks in flexbox. For example, 
		forced breaks on items in row-direction box could be ignored, similar to 
		behavior of inline elements in normal flow. Open for suggestions.
</p>
</li>
<li>When necessary, a <dfn>break inside a flexbox item is considered</dfn> as follows:

<ol>
	<li>If the item has
	“break-inside:avoid”, it is pushed to the next page</li>

	<li>Otherwise, it may be
	broken, according to breaking rules and algorithms applicable to its display
	type. </li>

	<li>Forced breaks inside flex item content are 
	handled normally, but in row-direction flexbox they don&#39;t affect layout of sibling flex items (e.g. a 
	forced break inside an item doesn&#39;t prevent its next 
	sibling from appearing on the same page)</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><b>Column-direction flexbox: single-line</b>

<ol>
	<li><p>If flexbox main-axis size is definite, flexbox algorithm must be run first, 
		without constraints of available space on page and using all content of the flexbox.
		Otherwise items use the preferred size, adjusted for min/max.

		<p>If page size varies and flexbox size depends on page size, this step has to be
		repeated on each page, again with the whole content of the flexbox.

	<li>Set of items that will fit
	on current page is determined by adding main-axis sizes of
	items until total size exceeds avaialble space or a forced break is encountered.</li>

	<li>If border box of an item
	doesn’t fit in available space, a break inside the item is considered</li>

	<li><p>Items that fit on a page
	completely or partially are aligned according to ‘flex-pack’ property,
	independently from the rest of flexbox content.
	<p>Note that flexible lenghts are not recalculated on each page, even if there is
	additional free space.
	</li>
</ol>

	<p class="note">It is the intent of this spec that column-direction 
	single-line flexbox paginates very simlarly to block 
	flow. As a test of the intent, a flexbox with "flex-pack:start" and no flexible items should paginate 
	identically to a block with non-floating children 
	with same content, same used size and same used margins. This 
	rule is simplified and not normative, but if there is any 
	difference it should be noted here.
</li>

<li><b>Column-direction flexbox: multi-line</b>

<ol>
<li>Items are collected in lines and
laid out as usual, but in available space on current page.</li>

<li>If border box of an item
doesn’t fit on main-axis, 

<ol>
<li>If it is the last item of
the last line, a break inside the item is considered</li>

<li>Otherwise
<ol>
	<li>If the flexbox is not at the top of the page, it is moved to the next page.</li>
	<li>If the flexbox is already at the top of the page, the item may produce overflow.
	If 'overflow' property of the flexbox is set to 'visible', it is paginated using same rules as visible
	overflow of blocks in normal flow

	<p class="note">After the break, continuation of overflow items may overlap with other items
	and/or content after the flexbox. It is undesirable but there is no good resolution for this
	spacial conflict and this outcome is similar to effect of "overflow:visible" elsewhere.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>

</li>

<li><b>Row-direction flexbox: single-line</b>

<ol>

<li><p>Main-axis space
distribution in each line is done based on complete content of the flexbox and without space constraint 
in block direction. 
<p>If page size varies and flexbox size depends on page size, 
this step needs to be repeated on each page
</li>

<li>Items are sized and positioned as usual, but in block-direction available space of 
min(remaining available space in flexbox, remaining space on the page).</li>

<li>Any items with baseline alignment must be aligned before considering breaks inside items.</li>

<li>If border box of an item doesn’t fit in current page, a break inside the item is considered</li>

<li>Items that have fit
completely on a previous page and items that are pushed to next page don’t have
any rendering, leaving empty space as needed.</li>

<li>Items that fit completely or partially on current page are aligned on cross-axis
<ol>

<li>For the purposes of
cross-axis alignment, minimum of remaining available space in flexbox and
available space at current page is used.</li>

<li>If an item is broken in
the previous step and its alignment is not baseline, its cross-axis size is set
to available space. If item alignment is baseline, its cross-axis size is
adjusted so that it extends to exactly the end of available space.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><b>Row-direction flexbox:multi-line</b>

<ol>

<li>Collect items into lines and determine line heights
	<ol>
		<li><p>If 'flex-line-pack' is 'stretch' and flexbox size in block direction is definite, 
		layout of the complete flexbox has to be done first to determine line heights. Layout
		is done as usual for non-paginated case, but accounting for forced breaks
		<p>If page size varies, this step may have to be redone, again with complete content; 
		special consideration should be to be given to line breaks to ensure that item at
		the start of current page is also at the start of a line in this hypothetical layout.
		This specification currently doesn't define how exactly to achieve that.</li>

		<li>Otherwise, items are collected into lines and each line is laid out as a single-line flexbox to determine
		block-direction size of each line.</li>
	</ol>
</li>	
<li>Lines are added one at a time, until out of available space or a forced break is encountered</li>

<li>If size of flexbox in inline direction is not definite, multi-line layout algorithm is run 
using the set of itesm that have fit on the current page. Lines that are crossing a page break

<li>Line packing is done on each page, with content on the page</li>

Document conventions</h3>

  <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
  descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
  “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
  “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
  letters in this specification.
  
  <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
  explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
  
  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
  or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
  like this:
  
  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the

  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Flexbox Layout Module
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>
  
  <p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Flexbox Layout Module
  if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
  according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
  feature defined in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Flexbox Layout Module
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by CSS Flexbox Layout Module by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Flexbox Layout Module
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>
  
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
  
  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>
 
<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
  
  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.
  
  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR exit criteria</h3>

  <p class=issue>[Change or remove the following CR exit criteria if
  the spec is not a module, but, e.g., a Note or a profile. This text was <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a>]</p>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>
  
  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.
