<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

	<p>
		This CSS module defines a two-dimensional grid-based layout system,
		optimized for user interface design.
		In the grid layout model,
		the children of a grid container can be positioned into arbitrary slots in a flexible or fixed predefined layout grid.

<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction and Overview</h2>

	<p>
		Grid layout contains features targeted at web application authors.
		The grid can be used to achieve many different layouts.
		It excels at dividing up space for major regions of an application,
		or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer
		between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

	<p>
		Like tables,
		grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows,
		but unlike tables,
		grid layout doesn't have content structure,
		and thus enables a wide variety of layouts not possible with tables.
		For example, the children of a grid container can position themselves
		such that they overlap and layer similar to positioned elements.

	<p>
		In addition, the absence of content structure in grid layout helps to manage changes to layout
		by using fluid and source order independent layout techniques.
		By combining media queries with the CSS properties that control layout of the grid container and its children,
		authors can adapt their layout to changes in device form factors, orientation, and available space,
		without needing to alter the semantic nature of their content.


<h3 id='background'>
Background and Motivation</h3>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<img class="figure" alt="Image: Application layout example requiring horizontal and vertical alignment." src="images/basic-form.png" />
		<p class="caption">Application layout example requiring horizontal and vertical alignment.
	</div>

	<p>
		As websites evolved from simple documents into complex, interactive applications,
		tools for document layout, e.g. floats,
		were not necessarily well suited for application layout.
		By using a combination of tables, JavaScript, or careful measurements on floated elements,
		authors discovered workarounds to achieve desired layouts.
		Layouts that adapted to the available space were often brittle
		and resulted in counter-intuitive behavior as space became constrained.
		As an alternative, authors of many web applications opted for a fixed layout
		that cannot take advantage of changes in the available rendering space on a screen.

	<p>
		The capabilities of grid layout address these problems.
		It provides a mechanism for authors to divide available space for layout into columns and rows
		using a set of predictable sizing behaviors.
		Authors can then precisely position and size the building block elements of their application
		by into <i>grid areas</i> defined by these columns and rows.
		Figure 1 illustrates a basic layout which can be achieved with grid layout.

Adapting Layouts to Available Space</h3>

		<p>
			<img alt="Image: Five grid items arranged according to content size and available space." src="images/game-smaller.png" />

		<p class="caption">
			Five grid items arranged according to content size and available space.

	<div class="sidefigure">

			<img alt="Image: Growth in the grid due to an increase in available space." src="images/game-larger.png" />

		<p class="caption">
			Growth in the grid due to an increase in available space.
	</div>

	<p>
		Grid layout can be used to intelligently reflow elements within a webpage.
		Figure 2 represents a game with five major areas in the layout:
		the game title, stats area, game board, score area, and control area.
		The author's intent is to divide the space for the game such that:

	<ul>
		<li>
			The stats area always appears immediately under the game title.
		<li>
			The game board appears to the right of the stats and title.
		<li>
			The top of the game title and the game board should always align.
		<li>
			The bottom of the game board and the stats area align when the game has reached its minimum height,
			but otherwise the game board will stretch to take advantage of all the screen real-estate available to it.
		<li>
			The score area should align into the column created by the game and stats area,
			while the controls are centered under the board.
	</ul>

	<p>
		As an alternative to using script to control the absolute position, width, and height of all elements,
		the author can use grid layout,
		as shown in Figure 3.
		The following example shows how an author might achieve all the sizing, placement, and alignment rules declaratively.

	<p>
		Note that there are multiple ways to specify the structure of the grid
		and to position and size <i>grid items</i>,
		each optimized for different scenarios.
		This example illustrates one that an author may use to define the position and space for each <i>grid item</i>
		using the 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns' properties on the <i>grid container</i>,
		and the 'grid-row' and 'grid-column' properties on each <i>grid item</i>.


	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
  #grid {
    display: grid;

    /* Two columns: the first sized to content, the second receives
     * the remaining space, but is never smaller than the minimum 
     * size of the board or the game controls, which occupy this 
     * column. */
    grid-template-columns: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr);

    /* Three rows: the first and last sized to content, the middle 
     * row receives the remaining space, but is never smaller than 
     * the minimum height of the board or stats areas. */
    grid-template-rows: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr) auto
  }

  /* Each part of the game is positioned between grid lines by 
   * referencing the starting grid line and then specifying, if more 
   * than one, the number of rows or columns spanned to determine 
   * the ending grid line, which establishes bounds for the part. */
  #title    { grid-column: 1; grid-row: 1 }
  #score    { grid-column: 1; grid-row: 3 }
  #stats    { grid-column: 1; grid-row: 2; justify-self: start }
  #board    { grid-column: 2; grid-row: 1 / span 2; }
  #controls { grid-column: 2; grid-row: 3; align-self: center }
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="grid">
  &lt;div id="title">Game Title&lt;/div>
  &lt;div id="score">Score&lt;/div>
  &lt;div id="stats">Stats&lt;/div>
  &lt;div id="board">Board&lt;/div>
  &lt;div id="controls">Controls&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre>

<h3 id='source-independence'>
Source Independence</h3>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<p>
			<img alt="Image: An arrangement suitable for portrait orientation." src="images/game-portrait.png" />

		<p class="caption">An arrangement suitable for ''portrait'' orientation.
	</div>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<p>
			<img alt="Image: An arrangement suitable for landscape orientation." src="images/game-landscape.png" />

		<p class="caption">An arrangement suitable for ''landscape'' orientation.
	</div>

	<p>
		Continuing the prior example,
		the author also wants the game to adapt to the space available on traditional computer monitors, handheld devices, or tablet computers.
		Also, the game should optimize the placement of the components when viewed either in landscape or portrait orientation (Figures 4 and 5).
		By combining grid layout with media queries,
		the author is able to use the same semantic markup,
		but rearrange the layout of elements independent of their source order,
		to achieve the desired layout in both orientations.

	<p>
		The following example leverages grid layout’s ability to name the space which will be occupied by a <i>grid item</i>.
		This allows the author to avoid rewriting rules for <i>grid items</i>
		as the grid’s definition changes.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
  @media (orientation: portrait) {
    #grid {
      display: grid;

      /* The rows, columns and areas of the grid are defined visually
       * using the grid-template-areas property.  Each string is a row, and
       * each word an area.  The number of words in a string 
       * determines the number of columns. Note the number of words 
       * in each string must be identical. */
      grid-template-areas: "title stats"
                           "score stats"
                           "board board"
                           "ctrls ctrls";

      /* Columns and rows created with the template property can be 
       * assigned a sizing function with the grid-template-columns 
       * and grid-template-rows properties. */
      grid-template-columns: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: auto auto minmax(min-content, 1fr) auto
    }
  }

  @media (orientation: landscape) {
    #grid {
      display: grid;

      /* Again the template property defines areas of the same name, 
       * but this time positioned differently to better suit a 
       * landscape orientation. */
      grid-template-areas: "title board"
                           "stats board"
                           "score ctrls";

      grid-template-columns: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr) auto
    }
  }

  /* The grid-area property places a grid item into a named 
   * region (area) of the grid. */
  #title    { grid-area: title }
  #score    { grid-area: score }
  #stats    { grid-area: stats }
  #board    { grid-area: board }
  #controls { grid-area: ctrls }
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="grid">

Grid Layering of Elements</h3>

		<p>
			<img alt="Image: A control composed of layered HTML elements." src="images/control-layering-and-alignment.png" />

		<p class="caption">A control composed of layered HTML elements.
	</div>

	<p>
		In the example shown in Figure 6,
		the author is creating a custom slider control.
		The control has six parts.
		The lower and upper labels align to the left and right edges of the control.
		The track of the slider spans the area between the labels.
		The lower and upper fill parts touch beneath the thumb,
		and the thumb is a fixed width and height that can be moved along the track
		by updating the two flex-sized columns.

	<p>
		Prior to the introduction of grid layout,
		the author would have likely used absolute positioning to control the top and left coordinates,
		along with the width and height of each HTML element that comprises the control.
		By leveraging grid layout,
		the author can instead limit script usage to handling mouse events on the thumb,
		which snaps to various positions along the track
		as the 'grid-template-columns' property of the <i>grid container</i> is updated.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
  #grid {
    display: grid;

    /* The grid-template-columns and rows properties also support 
     * naming grid lines which can then be used to position grid 
     * items.  The line names are assigned on either side of a column
     * or row sizing function where the line would logically exist. */
    grid-template-columns:

      (track-start)  0.5fr
      (thumb-start)  auto
      (fill-split)   auto
      (thumb-end)    0.5fr
      (track-end)    auto
      (end);
  }

  /* The grid-placement properties accept named lines. Below the
   * lines are referred to by name. Beyond any 
   * semantic advantage, the names also allow the author to avoid 
   * renumbering the grid-column-start and grid-row-start properties of the 
   * grid items.  This is similar to the concept demonstrated in the 
   * prior example with the grid-template-areas property during orientation 
   * changes, but grid lines can also work with layered grid items 
   * that have overlapping areas of different shapes like the thumb 
   * and track parts  in this example. */
  #lower-label { grid-column-start: start }
  #track       { grid-column: track-start / track-end; align-self: center }
  #upper-label { grid-column-end: end; }

  /* Fill parts are drawn above the track so set z-index to 5. */
  #lower-fill  { grid-column: track-start / fill-split; 
                 align-self: end; 
                 z-index: 5 }

  /* Thumb is the topmost part; assign it the highest z-index value. */
  #thumb       { grid-column: thumb-start / thumb-end; z-index: 10 }

Grid Layout Concepts and Terminology</h2>

	<p>
		In <dfn>grid layout</dfn>,
		the content of a <i>grid container</i> is laid out
		by positioning and aligning it into a <i>grid</i>.
		The <dfn>grid</dfn> is an intersecting set of horizontal and vertical <i>grid lines</i>
		that divides the <i>grid container</i>’s space into <i>grid areas</i>,
		into which <i>grid items</i> (representing the <i>grid container</i>’s content) can be placed.  
		There are two sets of <i>grid lines</i>: 
		one set defining <dfn title="grid column | column">columns</dfn>
		that run along the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#block-axis">block axis</a>,
		and an orthogonal set defining <dfn title="grid row | row">rows</dfn>
		along the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#inline-axis">inline axis</a>.

		<p class="caption">Grid lines: Three in the block axis and four in the inline axis.
	</div>

<h3 id="grid-track-concept">
Grid Tracks</h3>

	<p>
		<dfn>Grid track</dfn> is a generic term for a <i>grid column</i> or <i>grid row</i>&mdash;in
		other words, it is the space between two adjacent <i>grid lines</i>.
		Each <i>grid track</i> is assigned a sizing function,
		which controls how wide or tall the column or row may grow,
		and thus how far apart its bounding <i>grid lines</i> are.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			In the following example there are two columns and three rows.
			The first column is fixed at 150px.
			The second column uses flexible sizing, which is a function of the unassigned space in the Grid,
			and thus will vary as the width of the <i>grid container</i> changes.
			If the used width of the <i>grid container</i> is 200px, then the second column 50px wide.
			If the used width of the <i>grid element</i> is 100px, then the second column is 0px
			and any content positioned in the column will overflow the <i>grid container</i>.

		<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr; /* two columns */
		grid-template-rows: 50px 1fr 50px /* three rows  */
	}
&lt;/style></pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="grid-line-concept">
Grid Lines</h3>

	<p>
		<dfn id='grid-line' title='grid line|grid row line|grid column line'>Grid lines</dfn> are the horizontal and vertical dividing lines of the <i>grid</i>.
		A <i>grid line</i> exists on either side of a column or row.  
		They can be referred to by numerical index,
		or by an author-specified name.
		A <i>grid item</i> references the <i>grid lines</i> to determine its position within the <i>grid</i>
		using the <a href="#placement">grid-placement properties</a>.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			The following two examples create three column <i>grid lines</i> and four row <i>grid lines</i>.
			The first example demonstrates how an author would position a <i>grid item</i> using <i>grid line</i> numbers.
			The second example uses explicitly named <i>grid lines</i>.

		<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 1fr 50px
  }

  #item1 { grid-column: 2;
           grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 1; }
&lt;/style></pre>

    <pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
  /* equivalent layout to the prior example, but using named lines */
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 150px (item1-start) 1fr (item1-end);
    grid-template-rows: (item1-start) 50px 1fr 50px (item1-end);
  }

  #item1 {
    grid-column: item1-start / item1-end;
    grid-row: item1-start / item1-end
  }
&lt;/style></pre>
	</div>


<h3 id="grid-area-concept">
Grid Areas</h3>

	<p>
		A <dfn>grid area</dfn> is the logical space used to lay out one or more <i>grid items</i>.
		It is bound by four <i>grid lines</i>, one on each side of the <i>grid area</i>,
		and participates in the sizing of the <i>grid tracks</i> it intersects.
		A <i>grid area</i> can be named explicitly using the 'grid-template-areas' property of the <i>grid container</i>,
		or referenced implicitly by its bounding <i>grid lines</i>.
		A <i>grid item</i> is assigned to a <i>grid area</i>
		using the <a href="#placement">grid-placement properties</a>.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
  /* using the template syntax */
  #grid  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: ". a"
                       "b a"
                       ". a";
  grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 50px 1fr 50px
  }

  #item1 { grid-area: a }
  #item2 { grid-area: b }
  #item3 { grid-area: b }

  /* Align items 2 and 3 at different points in the Grid Area "b".  */
  /* By default, Grid Items are stretched to fit their Grid Area    */
  /* and these items would layer one over the other. */
  #item2 { align-self: head }
  #item3 { justify-self: end; align-self: foot }
&lt;/style></pre>

	<p>
		A <i>grid item</i>’s <i>grid area</i> forms the containing block into which it is laid out.
		Percentage lengths specified on a <i>grid item</i> resolve against this containing block.
		Percentages specified for 'margin-top', 'padding-top', 'margin-bottom', and 'padding-bottom' on a <i>grid item</i>
		resolve against the height of its containing block, 
		rather than the width (as for blocks).

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> placed into the same <i>grid area</i> do not directly affect each other's layout.
		Indirectly, a <i>grid item</i> can affect the position of a <i>grid line</i> in a column or row that uses a contents-based relative size,
		which in turn can affect the position or size of another <i>grid item</i>.

Grid Layout Box Model</h2>

Grid Containers: the ''grid'' and ''inline-grid'' 'display' values</h3>

	<table class='propdef'>

		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate an inline-level <i>grid container</i> box.
	</dl>

	<p>
		A <dfn>grid container</dfn> establishes a new <dfn>grid formatting context</dfn> for its contents.  
		This is the same as establishing a block formatting context,
		except that grid layout is used instead of block layout: 
		floats do not intrude into the grid container, 
		and the grid container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents.  
		<i>Grid containers</i> form a containing block for their contents
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#containing-block-details">exactly like block containers do</a>. [[!CSS21]]
		The 'overflow' property applies to <i>grid containers</i>.


	<p>
		Grid containers are not block containers, 
		and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of block layout don't apply in the context of grid layout.  
		In particular:

	<ul>
		<li>
			all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module have no effect on a grid container.

		<li>
			'float' and 'clear' have no effect on a <i>grid item</i>.
			(However, the 'float' property still affects the computed value of 'display' on children of a grid container,
			as this occurs <em title=''>before</em> <i>grid items</i> are determined.)

		<li>
			'vertical-align' has no effect on a grid item.

		<li>
			the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements do not apply to <i>grid containers</i>.
	</ul>

	<p>
		If an element's specified 'display' is ''inline-grid'' 
		and the element is floated or absolutely positioned, 
		the computed value of 'display' is <a href="#display-grid">''grid''</a>.
		The table in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Chapter 9.7</a> is thus amended 
		to contain an additional row, 
		with ''inline-grid'' in the "Specified Value" column 
		and <a href="#display-grid">''grid''</a> in the "Computed Value" column.


<h3>Subgrids: the ''subgrid'' 'display' value</h3>

	<div class="issue">
		This is a proposal to address the alignment of sub-items across grid items,
		so that, for example,
		a grid of labels + inputs (with each pair styled as a unit)
		can still align the individual elements in a greater grid.
		Potential issues:

		<ul>
			<li>
				If an item is positioned outside the subgrid's declared rows/columns,
				does the subgrid expand further into the outer grid,
				or just overflow within its declared bounds?
			<li>
				How to declare a subgrid? 
				As a separate display type, as illustrated here,
				or by assigning a "subgrid" value to grid-template-rows/columns
				(which would allow aligning to the parent grid in only one dimension)?
			<li>
				Can auto-placement in the subgrid determine/increase the size of the subgrid?
			<li>
				Should you be able to interleave lines from the parent grid with subgrid lines?
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>
		A <i>grid item</i> can itself be a <i>grid container</i> by giving it ''display: grid''; 
		in this case the layout of its contents will be independent of the layout of the grid it participates in.

	<p>
		In some cases it might be necessary for the contents of multiple <i>grid items</i> to align to each other; 
		in this case ''display: subgrid'' can be used. 
		A <i>grid item</i> with ''display: subgrid'' behaves just like one with ''display: grid'' except that:

	<ul>
		<li>
			The 'grid-template-columns' and 'grid-definition-row' properties do not apply.
			Instead the number of explicit tracks is given by its <i>grid span</i>.

		<li>
			The <i>grid span</i> of the item is determined by the number of grid rows and grid columns it contains.
			
		<li>
			The <i>grid-placement properties</i> are scoped to the tracks covered by the subgrid:
			numeric indices count starting from the first line of the subgrid
			rather than the first line of the parent grid.

		<li>
			The subgrid's own grid items participate in the sizing of its parent grid and are aligned to it.
			In this process, the sum of the item's margin, padding, and borders are applied as an extra layer of margin to the items at those edges.
	</ul>

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			For example, suppose we have a form consisting of a list of inputs with labels:
		<pre>
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input name=fn>
  &lt;li>&lt;label>Address:&lt;/label> &lt;input name=address>
  &lt;li>&lt;label>Phone:&lt;/label> &lt;input name=phone>
&lt;/ul></pre>

		<p>
			We want the labels and inputs to align, and we want to style each list item with a border.
			This can be accomplished with subgrid layout:

		<pre>
ul {
	display: grid;
	grid-auto-flow: rows;
	grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;
}
li {
	display: subgrid;
	margin: 0.5em;
	border: solid;
	padding: 0.5em;
}
label {
	grid-column: 1;
}
input {
	grid-column: 2;
}</pre>
	</div>

<h2 id="grid-items">
Grid Items</h2>

	<p>
		The contents of a <i>grid container</i> consists of zero or more <dfn id="grid-item" title="grid item">grid items</dfn>:
		each child of a <i>grid container</i>
		becomes a <i>grid item</i>,
		and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a <i>grid element</i>
		is wrapped in an anonymous <i>grid item</i>.
		However, an anonymous grid item that contains only
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#white-space-prop">white space</a>
		is not rendered, as if it were ''display:none''.

	<div class="issue">
		<p>
			This will place all of the contents of the grid on top of each other in slot 1 1.
			Alternatives:

		<ul>
			<li>Turn on auto-positioning by default (see 'grid-auto-flow').
			<li>Place all unpositioned elements in the grid into an anonymous grid item in slot 1 1.
			<li>Place all unpositioned elements in the grid into an anonymous grid item whose position is given by a "*" template slot,
			else is in slot 1 1.
			<li>Same as the previous, except if there is no "*" template slot, auto-position the children.
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>
		A <i>grid item</i> establishes a new formatting context for its contents.
		The type of this formatting context is determined by its 'display' value, as usual.
		The computed 'display' of a <i>grid item</i>
		is determined by applying the table in
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Chapter 9.7</a>.
		However, grid items are grid-level boxes, not block-level boxes:
		they participate in their container's <i>grid formatting context</i>,
		not in a block formatting context.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			Examples of grid items:
		<pre>
&lt;div style="display:grid">

	&lt;!-- grid item: block child -->
	&lt;div id="item1">block&lt;/div>

	&lt;!-- grid item: floated element; floating is ignored -->
	&lt;div id="item2" style="float: left;">float&lt;/div>

	&lt;!-- grid item: anonymous block box around inline content -->
	anonymous item 3

	&lt;!-- grid item: inline child -->
	&lt;span>
		item 4
		&lt;!-- grid items do not split around blocks -->
		&lt;div id=not-an-item>item 4&lt;/div>
		item 4
	&lt;/span>
&lt;/div></pre>
	</div>

	<p>
		Some values of 'display' trigger the generation of anonymous boxes.
		For example, a misparented ''table-cell'' child is fixed up
		by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">generating anonymous ''table'' and ''table-row'' elements</a> around it. [[!CSS21]]
		This fixup must occur <em>before</em> a <i>grid container</i>’s children are promoted to <i>grid items</i>.
		For example, given two contiguous child elements with ''display:table-cell'',
		an anonymous table wrapper box around them becomes the <i>grid item</i>.

	<p class='note'>
		Future display types may generate anonymous containers (e.g. ruby) or otherwise mangle the box tree (e.g. run-ins).
		It is intended that grid item determination run after these operations.


<h3 id="position-grid">
Non-children Grid Items</h3>

	<p class="issue">
		This is a proposal to create the ability to have descendants of a grid item participate in a grid layout,
		similar to the behavior defined by the Template Layout module.

	<p>
		A descendant of the grid can be pulled out of flow and participate directly in the grid
		by assigning it ''position: grid''.
		An element with ''position: grid'' is pulled out of flow and participates as a grid item
		belonging to the first ancestor with ''display: grid''.
		If the element is positioned using named lines or slots,
		it belongs to the first ancestor with ''display: grid'' that has all of the corresponding named lines/slots.
		If no such ancestor exists, the item remains in flow.

	<p class="issue">
		Alternatively, the item can just go into the first grid,
		and missing names are treated as ''auto''.

<h3 id="abspos-items">
Absolutely-positioned Grid Children</h3>

	<p>
		An absolutely-positioned child element of a <i>grid container</i> does not participate directly in grid layout.
		Its static position is ???

	<p class='issue'>
		The static position is affected by the alignment properties, 
		as if it was a 0x0 thing floating around in the containing block.
		(Defaults to the start/start corner, since 'stretch' can't do anything to it.)

	<p>
		If an absolutely positioned element's <i>containing block</i>
		is generated by a <i>grid container</i>,
		the <i>grid-placement properties</i> can be used to constrain it to a particular <i>grid area</i>,
		similar to how they affect regular <i>grid items</i>.
		In this case, an ''auto'' value for a <i>grid-placement property</i> indicates the corresponding padding edge of the <i>grid container</i>.

	<p class='note'>
		This can allow an abspos to "skip past" intervening grid containers,
		and resolve its grid-placement properties against a grid container
		other than its closest ancestor.

<h3 id="visibility-collapse">
Collapsed Grid Items: the 'visibility' property</h3>
<!--
	<p>
		Specifying ''visibility: collapse'' on a <i>grid item</i> causes it to become a <dfn title="collapsed grid item|collapsed">collapsed grid item</dfn>.
		This has the same effect as ''visibility: hidden'',
		except that if all the <i>grid items</i> spanning a track are <i>collapsed</i>,
		the track's intrinsic size becomes zero.
-->
	<p class='issue'>
		We want the ability to collapse grid tracks (similar to collapsing flex items or table rows/columns), but we're not sure exactly how to do it.
		Ideas welcome, please post them to the list.


<h3 id='order-property'>
Reordered Grid Items: the 'order' property</h3>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#order-property"><dfn id='order'>'order'</dfn></a> property, 
		defined in [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]], 
		also applies to <i>grid items</i>.
		It affects their <a href="#grid-auto-flow-property">auto-placement</a> and <a href="#z-order">painting order</a>.


<h2 id='grid-definition'>
Defining the Grid</h2>

	<p>
		The three properties 'grid-template-rows', 'grid-template-columns', and 'grid-template-areas'
		together define the <dfn>explicit grid</dfn> of a <i>grid container</i>.
		The 'grid-template' property is a shorthand that sets all three at the same time.
		The final grid may end up larger due to <i>grid items</i> placed outside the <i>explicit grid</i>;
		in this case, any implicit tracks are sized by the 'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns' properties.

	<p>
		The size of the <i>explicit grid</i> is determined by the larger of 
		the number of rows/columns defined by 'grid-template-areas'
		and the number of rows/columns sized by 'grid-template-rows'/'grid-template-columns'.
		Any rows/columns defined by 'grid-template-areas' but not sized by 'grid-template-rows'/'grid-template-columns'
		take their size from the 'grid-auto-rows'/'grid-auto-columns' properties.

	<p>
		Numeric indexes in the <i>grid-placement properties</i>
		count from the edges of the <i>explicit grid</i>.
		Positive indexes count from the before/start side,
		while negative indexes count from the after/end side.

		Each sizing function can be specified as a length,
		a percentage of the <i>grid container</i>’s size,
		a measurement of the contents occupying the column or row,
		or a fraction of the free space in the grid.
		It can also be specified as a range using the ''minmax()'' notation,
		which can combine any of the previously mentioned mechanisms to define a min and max size for the column or row.

	<p>
		The 'grid-template-columns' property specifies the <i>track list</i> for the grid's columns,
		while 'grid-template-rows' specifies the <i>track list</i> for the grid's rows.
		The syntax of a <i>track list</i> is:

	<pre>
<dfn>&lt;track-list></dfn>    = [ <var>&lt;line-names></var>? [ <var>&lt;track-size></var> | <var>&lt;repeat-function></var> ] ]+ <var>&lt;line-names></var>?

	</dl>

	<p>
		The <dfn id='grid-definition-none'>none</dfn> value indicates that there is no initial grid;
		any rows/columns will be implicitly generated,
		and their size will be determined by the 'grid-auto-rows' and 'grid-auto-columns' properties.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Given the following 'grid-template-columns' declaration:

		<pre>grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr max-content minmax(min-content, 1fr);</pre>

		<p>
			Five grid lines are created:

		<ol>
			<li>
				At the start edge of the <i>grid container</i>.

			<li>
				100px from the start edge of the <i>grid container</i>.

			<li>
				A distance from the previous line equal to half the <i>free space</i>
				(the width of the <i>grid container</i>, minus the width of the non-flexible <i>grid tracks</i>).

			<li>
				A distance from the previous line equal to the maximum size of any <i>grid items</i>
				belonging to the column between these two lines.

			<li>
				A distance from the previous line at least as large as the largest minimum size of any <i>grid items</i>
				belonging to the column between these two lines,
				but no larger than the other half of the <i>free space</i>.
		</ol>

		<p>
			If the non-flexible sizes
			(''100px'', ''max-content'', and ''min-content'')
			sum to larger than the <i>grid container</i>’s width,
			the final <i>grid line</i> will be a distance equal to their sum away from the start edge of the <i>grid container</i>
			(the ''1fr'' sizes both resolve to ''0'').
			If the sum is less than the <i>grid container</i>’s width,
			the final <i>grid line</i> will be exactly at the end edge of the <i>grid container</i>.
			This is true in general whenever there's at least one <var>&lt;flex></var> value among the <i>grid track</i> sizes.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Additional examples of valid <i>grid track</i> definitions:

grid-template-rows: calc(4em - 5px)</pre>
	</div>

	<p class='issue'>
		We should have some way of defining "gutter" columns/rows,
		where content can never go
		(unless it's spanning across two tracks).
		Otherwise, auto-flow is completely broken when you manually add gutters,
		and it's just much less convenient to add them manually.

<h4 id='named-lines'>
Named Grid Lines</h4>

	<p>
		While <i>grid lines</i> can always be referred to by their numerical index,
		they can also be explicitly named in the 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns' properties.
		This can make the <i>grid-placement properties</i> easier to understand
		by using meaningful names in their values,
		and easier to maintain if the grid definition changes in the future.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			For example,
			the following code gives meaningful names to all of the lines in the grid.
			Note that some of the lines have multiple names.

		<pre>&lt;style>
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: (first nav) 150px (main) 1fr (last);
    grid-template-rows: (first header) 50px (main) 1fr (footer) 50px (last);
  }
&lt;/style></pre>

		<div class="figure">
			<img class="figure" alt="Image: Named Grid Lines." src="images/grid-named-lines.png" />
			<p class="caption">Named Grid Lines.

	</div>

	<p class="issue">
		Consider merging grid line names with grid field names. See: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Sep/0047.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Sep/0047.html</a> for proposal.


<h4 id='repeat-notation'>
Repeating Rows and Columns: the ''repeat()'' notation</h4>

	<p>
		The ''repeat()'' notation represents a repeated fragment of the <i>track list</i>.
		This is just a syntactic shorthand that allows writing a large number of columns or rows that exhibit a recurring pattern in a more compact form.
		The syntax of the ''repeat()'' notation is:

	<pre class='prod'>
<dfn>&lt;repeat-function></dfn> = repeat( <var>&lt;positive-integer></var> , [ <var>&lt;string></var>* <var>&lt;track-size></var> ]+ <var>&lt;string></var>* )</pre>

	<p>
		The first argument specifies the number of repetitions.
		The second argument is a <i>track list</i>,
		which is repeated that number of times.
		The ''repeat()'' notation cannot be nested;
		doing so makes the declaration invalid.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			This example shows two equivalent ways of writing the same grid definition.
			Both ways produce a grid with a single row and four "main" columns, each 250px wide,
			surrounded by 10px "gutter" columns.

		<pre>
&lt;style>
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 10px (col-start) 250px (col-end) 
                           10px (col-start) 250px (col-end) 
                           10px (col-start) 250px (col-end) 
                           10px (col-start) 250px (col-end) 10px;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
  }

  /* Equivalent definition. */
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 10px (col-start) 250px (col-end)) 10px;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
  }
&lt;/style></pre>
	</div>

<h4 id='fr-unit'>
Flexible Lengths: the ''fr'' unit</h4>

	<p>
		A <dfn>flexible length</dfn> is a dimension with the ''fr'' unit,
		which represents a fraction of the <i>free space</i> in the <i>grid container</i>.

	<p>
		The distribution of <i>free space</i> occurs after all non-flexible <i>sizing functions</i> have reached their maximum.
		The total size of such rows or columns is subtracted from the available space, yielding the <dfn>free space</dfn>,
		which is then divided among the flex-sized rows and columns in proportion to their flex factor.

	<p class='note'>
		Flexible lengths in a <i>track list</i> work similarly to flexible lengths with a zero base size in [[CSS3-FLEXBOX]].

	<p>
		Each column or row's share of the <i>free space</i> can be computed as the column or row's
		<code>&lt;flex> * &lt;free space> / &lt;sum of all flex factors></code>.
		For the purpose of this calculation,
		a flexible length in the <var>min</var> position of a ''minmax()'' function is treated as ''0'' (an inflexible length).

	<p>
		When the available space is infinite
		(which happens when the <i>grid container</i>’s width or height is <i>indefinite</i>),
		flex-sized <i>grid tracks</i> are sized to their contents while retaining their respective proportions.
		The used size of each flex-sized <i>grid track</i> is computed by 
		determining the 'max-content' size of each flex-sized <i>grid track</i> 
		and dividing that size by the respective flex factor
		to determine a <dfn>hypothetical 1fr size</dfn>.
		The maximum of those is used as the ''1fr'' length,
		which is then multiplied by each <i>grid track</i>’s flex factor to determine its final size.

<h4 id='resolved-track-list'>
Resolved Values</h4>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#resolved-values">resolved value</a> of the 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns' properties is the used value,
		serialized as follows:

	<ul>
		<li>
			Every track listed,
			whether implicitly or explicitly created.

		<li>
			Every track size given as a length in pixels, 
			regardless of sizing function.

		<li>
			A contiguous run of two or more tracks that have the same size and associated line names
			may be serialized with the ''repeat()'' notation.
	</ul>

	<div class="example">
		<pre>
&lt;style>
  #grid {
    width: 500px;
    grid-template-columns:
      (a)     auto
      (b)     minmax(min-content, 1fr)
      (b c d) repeat(2, (e) 40px)
              repeat(5, auto);
  }
&lt;/style>
&lt;div id="grid">

  // (a) 50px (b) 320px (b c d) repeat(2, (e) 40px) repeat(4, 0px) 50px
&lt;/script></pre>

	<p class='issue'>
		In general, resolved values are the computed values,
		except for a small list of legacy 2.1 properties.
		Do we really want these properties to return the used value here?

		The 'grid-template' property is a shorthand for setting
		'grid-template-columns', 'grid-template-rows', and 'grid-template-areas' in a single declaration.
		It has three distinct syntax forms:

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>''none''</dfn>
		<dd>
			Sets all three properties to their initial values (''none'').

		<dt><dfn><var>&lt;'grid-template-columns'></var> / <var>&lt;'grid-template-rows'></var></dfn>
		<dd>
			Sets 'grid-template-columns' and 'grid-template-rows' to the specified values, respectively,
			and sets 'grid-template-areas' to ''none''.

			<div class='example'>
				<pre>grid-template: auto 1fr auto / auto 1fr;</pre>

				<p>
					is equivalent to

				<pre>
grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto;
grid-template-rows: auto 1fr;
grid-template-areas: none;</pre>
			</div>

		<dt><dfn>[ <var>&lt;'grid-template-columns'></var> / ]?<br>

				<li>
					Sets 'grid-template-columns' to the track listing specified before the slash
					(or ''none'', if not specified).

				<li>
					Sets 'grid-template-areas' to the strings listed after the slash.

				<li>
					Sets 'grid-template-rows' to the <var>&lt;track-size></var>s following each string
					(filling in ''auto'' for any missing sizes),
					and splicing in the named lines defined before/after each size.
			</ul>

		<dfn title="implicit grid track|implicit grid row|implicit grid column">implicit grid tracks</dfn> are created to hold it.
		This can happen either by explicitly positioning into a row or column that is out of range,
		or by the <i>auto-placement algorithm</i> creating additional rows or columns.

Automatic Grid Item Placement Algorithm</h4>
	<p>
		The following summarizes the algorithm for auto placement of <i>Grid items</i>:

	<ol>
		<li>
			For each <i>Grid item</i> with a major-axis position that is not ''auto'' in source order:
			<ol>
				<li>Resolve the ''auto'' value for its minor-axis position to the minimum value that ensures this item's <i>grid area</i> will not overlap the <i>grid area</i> of any explicitly or previously auto-placed item.
			</ol>

		<li>
			Determine the maximum number of minor tracks based on maximum track number implied by the 'grid-template-areas' property, the 'grid-template-rows' and 'grid-template-columns' properties, the position and size of any explicitly-defined <i>grid items</i>, or any minor-axis ''auto'' values resolved by the step 1 of the algorithm. Note that this step must be run prior to the layout algorithm.
		<li>
			Position the <i>auto-placement cursor</i> at position 1,1 in the grid.
		<li>
			For each <i>grid item</i> having an unresolved value of ''auto'', in source order:
			<ol>
				<li>
					If the minor-axis position is not ''auto'', then:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Set the minor-axis position of the cursor to be equal to the minor-axis position of the <i>grid item</i>.
						<li>
							Increment the <i>auto-placement cursor</i> along the major-axis until a value is found where the <i>grid item</i> does not overlap the <i>grid area</i> of any other <i>grid item</i> (creating new major-axis tracks as necessary).
					</ol>

				<li>
					If the minor and major-axis positions are both ''auto'', then:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Increment the minor-axis position of the <i>auto-placement cursor</i> until this item's <i>grid area</i> does not overlap another item's <i>grid area</i>, or causes the <i>grid area</i> to exceed the maximum number of minor-axis tracks previously determined in step 2.
						<li>
							If this item's position is still unresolved after the previous step, then increment the cursor's major-axis position and reset the minor-axis position to 1 (creating new major-axis tracks if necessary).
					</ol>
			</ol>
	</ol>

	<div class='issue'>
		Two mistakes in the algorithm currently:

		<ol>
			<li>Step 2 needs to take into account the major-axis spans of every item as well.  Otherwise, extra-wide single items can create new columns late in auto-placement.

			<li>Step 4 needs to verify that placement also doesn't cause the item to generate new columns.  Currently, it only verifies that placement wont' overlap anything else.
		</ol>
	</div>


	<p class='issue'>
		This algorithm creates a "sparse" packing,
		where holes left behind are never filled in.
		This is more efficient and predictable
		(items never move to a position far above/before their preceding sibling),
		but the gaps are unwanted by authors in some situations.
		We should have a switch to allow for dense packing.
		(WebKit's current implementation does dense packing.)

<h2 id='alignment'>
Alignment</h2>

	<p>
		After a <i>grid container</i>’s <i>grid tracks</i> have been sized,
		and the dimensions of all <i>grid items</i> are finalized, 
		<i>grid items</i> can be aligned within their <i>grid areas</i>.

	<p>
		The 'margin' properties can be used to align items in a manner similar to, 
		but more powerful than, 
		what margins can do in block layout.
		<i>Grid items</i> also respect the alignment properties from the Box Alignment spec,
		which allow easy keyword-based alignment of items in both the <i>row axis</i> and <i>column axis</i>.

	<p>
		By default,
		<i>grid items</i> stretch to fill their <i>grid area</i>.
		However, if 'justify-self' or 'align-self' compute to a value other than ''stretch''
		or margins are ''auto'',
		<i>grid items</i> will auto-size to fit their contents.

	<p>
		<em>This section is non-normative.  
			The normative definition of how margins affect grid items is in the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Grid Layout Algorithm</a> section.</em>

	<p>
		Auto margins on <i>grid items</i> have an effect very similar to auto margins in block flow:

	<ul>
		<li>
			During calculations of <i>grid track</i> sizes, auto margins are treated as ''0''.

		<li>
			Auto margins absorb positive free space
			prior to alignment via the alignment properties
			(defined in the next sections).

		<li>
			Overflowing elements ignore their auto margins and overflow in the <i>end</i> directions.
	</ul>

	<p class='note'>
		Note that, if free space is distributed to auto margins, 
		the alignment properties will have no effect in that dimension
		because the margins will have stolen all the free space
		left over after sizing.

<h3 id='row-align'>
Row-axis Alignment: the 'justify-self' and 'justify-items' properties</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> can be aligned in the inline dimension 
		by using the 'justify-self' property on the <i>grid item</i>
		or 'justify-items' property on the <i>grid container</i>,
		as defined in [[!CSS3-ALIGN]].

	<div class='example'>
		For example,
		for an English document,
		the inline axis is horizontal,
		and so the 'justify-*' properties align the <i>grid items</i> horizontally.

		<pre>
TODO: provide example
		</pre>
	</div>




<h3 id='column-align'>
Column-axis Alignment: the 'align-self' and 'align-items' properties</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> can also be aligned in the block dimension
		(perpendicular to the inline dimension)
		by using the 'align-self' property on the <i>grid item</i>
		or 'align-items' property on the <i>grid container</i>,
		as defined in [[!CSS3-ALIGN]].

<h3 id='z-order'>
Z-axis Ordering: the 'z-index' property</h3>


	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> can overlap when they are positioned into intersecting <i>grid areas</i>.
		<i>Grid item</i> boxes in non-intersecting areas can also overlap because of negative margins or positioning.

	<p>
		When <i>grid items</i> overlap, 
		the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-z-index">'z-index'</a> property provides control over the drawing order of <i>grid items</i>.
		<i>Grid items</i> paint <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/#painting">exactly the same as flex items</a> [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]]:
		they use 'order'-modified document order,
		and 'z-index' values other than ''auto'' create a stacking context even if 'position' is ''static''.

	<p class='note'>
		Note: Descendants that are positioned outside a grid item still participate in any stacking context established by the grid item.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			The following diagram shows several overlapping grid items,
			with a combination of implicit source order
			and explicit 'z-index'
			used to control their stacking order.

Grid Baselines</h3>

	<p>
		The baselines of a <i>grid container</i> are determined as follows:

	<ol>
		<li>
			If any of the <i>grid items</i> whose areas intersect the <i>grid container</i>’s first row/column
			<a href="#baseline-participation">participate in baseline alignment</a>,
			the grid container's baseline is the baseline of those <i>grid items</i>.

		<li>
			Otherwise, if the grid container has at least one <i>grid item</i> whose area intersects the first row/column,
			and the first such <i>grid item</i> (in <i>'order'-modified grid order</i>) has a baseline
			parallel to the relevant axis,
			the grid container's baseline is that baseline.

		<li>
			Otherwise, the grid container's baseline is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#inline-alignment">synthesized</a> 
			from the first item's (in <i>'order'-modified grid order</i>) content box, 
			or, failing that, from the grid container's content box.
	</ol>

	<p>
		A <i>grid item</i> <dfn id="baseline-participation">participates in baseline alignment</dfn> in a particular dimension
		if its value for 'align-self' or 'justify-self', as appropriate, is ''baseline'' 
		and its inline axis is parallel to that dimension.

	<p>
		<dfn>'order'-modified grid order</dfn> is the order in which
		<i>grid items</i> are encountered when traversing the grid's <i>grid cells</i>,
		in row-major order if calculating the inline-axis baseline,
		or in column-major order if calculating the block-axis baseline.
		If two items are encountered at the same time,
		they are taken in 'order'-modified document order.

	<p>
		When calculating the baseline according to the above rules,
		if the box contributing a baseline has an 'overflow' value that allows scrolling,
		the box must be treated as being in its initial scroll position
		for the purpose of determining its baseline.

	<p>
		When <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#height-layout">determining the baseline of a table cell</a>,
		a grid container provides a baseline just as a line box or table-row does. [[!CSS21]]

		<p>
			This is the core <i>Grid track</i> sizing algorithm.  It is run for Grid columns and Grid rows.  The goal of the function is to ensure:

		<ol>
			<li>That each <i>Grid track</i> satisfies its MinTrackSizingFunction
			<li>That each <i>Grid track</i> grows from the breadth which satisfied its MinTrackSizingFunction to a breadth which satisfies its MaxTrackSizingFunction, subject to RemainingSpace.
		</ol>
		<p>
			For the purposes of resolving the breadth that satisfies the MinTrackSizingFunction and MaxTrackSizingFunction, each <i>Grid track</i> falls into one of three categories:

		<ol>
			<li>A percentage or length value which can be trivially resolved.
			<li>A min-content or max-content value which will be resolved based on the measurements of the <i>Grid items</i> which cover the <i>Grid track</i>.
			<li>A flexible length which can only be resolved after determining the RemainingSpace in the <i>Grid element</i>’s content box after having considered all contributions from the prior two categories of <i>Grid tracks</i>.
		</ol>
		<p>
			The breadths which satisfy MinTrackSizingFunctions and MaxTrackSizingFunctions for the first category of <i>Grid tracks</i> are resolved in step 1 during <i>Grid track</i> variable initialization.
			The breadths which satisfy the MinTrackSizingFunctions and the MaxTrackSizingFunctions for the second category of content-sized <i>Grid tracks</i> are resolved in step 2.  At the end of step 2, the first goal of ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks function has been satisfied:
			the UsedBreadth variable of each GridTrack now satisfies its MinTrackSizingFunction. The MaxBreadth variable for each <i>Grid track</i> now contains the resolved value for its MaxTrackSizingFunction.

		<p>
			In step 3, the second goal of this function is satisfied as each (non-flex-sized) <i>Grid track</i>
			attempts to grow from the UsedBreadth value to the MaxBreadth value, subject to RemainingSpace.

		<p>
			Finally in step 4, the third category of flex-sized <i>Grid tracks</i> can be resolved using what is now the RemainingSpace having updated the UsedBreadth of each <i>Grid track</i> at the end of step 3.

			The purpose of this function is to resolve the contribution that each <i>Grid item</i> makes to any min-content or max-content TrackSizingFunctions for the <i>Grid tracks</i> it covers. There are four permutations: min-content or max-content in either the MinTrackSizingFunction or MaxTrackSizingFunction. MinTrackSizingFunctions are resolved before MaxTrackSizingFunctions, and min-content contributions are resolved before max-content contributions. Note that when resolving min-content contributions they may grow tracks that have either min-content or max-content keywords, as seen in 3.a.i and 3.b.i below.

		<p class="issue">
			Currently this algorithm embodies several heuristics which regulate the growth of spanning <i>Grid items</i> to accommodate certain use cases. (E.g. the game example in Figures 2 and 3 above.) These heuristics should be a normative part of this specification to ensure interoperability. To the extent additional use cases can be identified that cannot be satisfied by following the current heuristics, the normative algorithm can be updated, or additional mechanisms can be introduced for fine-grained control of content-based TrackSizingFunction.

		<p>
			There are two parts to this function.  The first for loop in step 2 is giving each <i>Grid track</i> an equal share of the space, but without exceeding their TrackGrowthConstraint values.
			Because there are different MaxBreadths assigned to the different <i>Grid tracks</i>, the first loop can result in their uneven growth.

			Note that <i>Grid tracks</i> considered by this function may have a TrackGrowthConstraint equal to Infinity, which signals that these tracks have not yet been grown by a <i>Grid item</i>. These tracks can therefore be grown without exceeding the TrackGrowthConstraint of the track. By only growing tracks up to their TrackGrowthConstraint value, we can ensure that the grid remains "tight" - that is, that track breadth is as close to the content size of the <i>Grid items</i> inside as possible.

		This method computes a ''1fr'' value, referred to as the NormalizedFlexBreadth, for a set of <i>Grid tracks</i>.  The value computed will ensure that when the NormalizedFlexBreadth is multiplied by the flex factors associated with GridTracks, that the UsedBreadths of GridTracks will increase by an amount equal to the maximum of zero and the specified SpaceToFill less the sum of the current UsedBreadths.

Defining the Shrink-to-fit Behavior of Grid Elements</h3>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#shrink-to-fit">CSS3 Box Model</a> defines the shrink-to-fit behavior of an element as min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width), with available width defined in the Box Model spec. Accordingly, for the <i>Grid element</i> we define the preferred minimum width as the sum of the UsedBreadths of the <i>Grid tracks</i> just before step 3 in ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks, and the preferred width as the sum of the UsedBreadths of the <i>Grid tracks</i> after the entire track sizing algorithm has been run with infinite space.

<h3 id="interactions">
Module interactions</h3>

	<p>
		This module extends the definition of the 'display' property [[!CSS21]],
		adding a new block-level and new inline-level display type,
		and defining a new type of formatting context
		along with properties to control its layout.
		None of the properties defined in this module apply to the ''::first-line'' or ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>
		This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]].
		Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
		Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types:
		for example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module,
		expands the definition of the <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> value type as used in this specification.

	<p>
		In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
		all properties defined in this specification also accept the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">''inherit''</a> keyword as their property value.
		For readability it has not been repeated explicitly.

<h3 id="conventions">
Document conventions</h3>

	<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
	“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
	“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification.

	<p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
	explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:

	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

	<p>Conformance to CSS Grid Layout Module
	is defined for three conformance classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
			style sheet</a>.
		<dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
			documents that use them.
		<dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that writes a style sheet.
	</dl>

	<p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Grid Layout Module
	if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
	according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
	feature defined in this module.

	<p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Grid Layout Module
	if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
	appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
	by CSS Grid Layout Module by parsing them correctly
	and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
	UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
	does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
	required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)

	<p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Grid Layout Module
	if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
	generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
	this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
	as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

	<p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
	assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
	treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
	as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
	and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
	support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
	ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
	multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
	(as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
	be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

	<p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
	reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
	syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.

	<p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
	in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
	experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
	use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
	W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
	in the draft.
	</p>

<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

	<p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
	non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
	release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
	can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.

	<p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
	implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
	CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
	testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
	releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
	submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
	Working Group.

	<p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
	can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
	Questions should be directed to the
	<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
	mailing list.
