Abstract</h2>

  <p>
    This module describes the fragmentation model that partitions a flow 
    into pages, columns, or regions.
    It builds on the Page model module and introduces and defines the fragmentation
    model. It adds functionality for pagination, breaking variable fragment size and
    orientation, widows and orphans.

Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is not normative.</em></p>
  <p>
    In paged media (e.g., paper, transparencies, photo album pages, pages
    displayed on computer screens as printed output simulations), as
    opposed to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html#continuous-media-group">
    continuous media</a>, the content of the document is split into one or
    more discrete display surfaces. In order to avoid awkward breaks
    (such as halfway through a line of text), the layout engine must be
    able to shift around content that would fall across the page break.
    This process is called <dfn>pagination</dfn>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In CSS, in addition to paged media, certain layout features such as
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/">regions</a> [[CSS3-REGIONS]]
    and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">multi-column layout</a>
    [[CSS3COL]] create a similarly fragmented environment.
    The generic term for breaking content across containers is
    <dfn>fragmentation</dfn>.
    This module explains how content breaks across <i>fragmentation containers</i> (<i>fragmentainers</i>)
    such as pages and columns and how such breaks can be
    <a href="#breaking-controls">controlled by the author</a>.
  </p>

Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>
    This module replaces and extends the pagination controls defined in
    [[CSS21]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html#page-breaks">section 13.3</a>
    and in [[CSS3PAGE]].

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>
    This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">
    CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined
    in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]]. Other CSS
    modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for example [[CSS-VALUES]],
    when combined with this module, adds the ''initial'' value
    to the properties defined here.</p>
  <p>
    In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties
    defined in this specification also accept the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">
    inherit</a> keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been
    repeated explicitly.

<h2 id="fragmentation-model">
Fragmentation Model and Terminology</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>fragmentation container</dfn> (<dfn>fragmentainer</dfn>)</dt>
    <dd>
      A box&mdash;such as a page box, column box, or region&mdash;that contains
      a portion (or all) of a <i>fragmented flow</i>.
      Fragmentainers can be pre-defined, or generated as needed.
      When breakable content overflows a fragmentainer in the block dimension,
      instead of overflowing it breaks into the next container in its
      <i>fragmentation context</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmentation context</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      An ordered series of <i>fragmentainers</i>,
      such as created by a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">multi-column element</a>,
      a chain of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions">CSS regions</a>,
      or a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/">paged media display</a>.
      A given fragmentation context can only have one block flow direction
      across all its <i>fragmentainers</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmented flow</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A content flow that is being laid out in a <i>fragmentation context</i>.
      The <i>fragmented flow</i> consists of the content of a (possibly anonymous) box
      called the <dfn>fragmentation root</dfn>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmentation direction</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The block flow direction of the <i>fragmentation context</i>,
      i.e. the direction in which content is fragmented.
      (In this level of CSS, content only fragments in one dimension.)
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmentation</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The process of splitting a content flow across the <i>fragmentainers</i>
      that form a <i>fragmentation context</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>box fragment</dfn> or <dfn>fragment</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The portion of a box that belongs to exactly one <i>fragmentainer</i>.
      A box in continuous flow always consists of only one fragment.
      A box in a fragmented flow consists of one or more fragments.
    <dt><dfn>remaining fragmentainer extent</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The remaining extent in the <i>fragmentainer</i> available to a given element,
      i.e. between the end of preceding content in <i>fragmentainer</i>
      and the edge of the <i>fragmentainer</i>.
  </dl>

  <p>
    Each <dfn>fragmentation break</dfn> (hereafter, <dfn>break</dfn>)
    ends layout of the fragmented box in the current <i>fragmentainer</i>
    and causes the remaining content to be laid out in the next <i>fragmentainer</i>,
    in some cases causing a new <i>fragmentainer</i> to be generated
    to hold the deferred content.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Breaking inline content into lines is another form of fragmentation,
    and similarly creates box fragments when it breaks
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#inline-boxes">inline boxes</a>
    across <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a>.
    However, inline breaking is not covered here; see [[!CSS21]]/[[CSS3TEXT]].
  </p>

<h3 id="parallel-flows">
Parallel Fragmentation Flows</h3>

  <p>
    When multiple flows are laid out parallel to each other,
    fragmentation is performed independently in each flow.
    For example, if an element is floated,
    then a forced break inside the float
    will not affect the content wrapping outside the float
    (except insofar as it may increase the height of the float).
  </p>

  <p>
    The following are examples of parallel flows
    whose contents will fragment independently:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The contents of a float vs. the content wrapping outside the float.
    <li>The contents of a float vs. the contents of an adjacent float.
    <li>The contents of each table cell in a single table row.
    <li>The contents of each grid item in a single grid row.
    <li>The contents of each flex item in a flex layout row.
    <li>The contents of absolutely-positioned elements
        that cover the same range of their containing block's fragmentation context.
  </ul>

  <p>
    Content overflowing the content edge of a fixed-size box
    is considered parallel to the content after the fixed-size box.
    Such content fragments within the context of the box's <i>fragmented flow</i>
    following normal fragmentation rules,
    increasing the length of the <i>fragmented flow</i> as necessary.
  </p>

<h3 id="nested-flows">
Nested Fragmentation Flows</h3>

  <p>
    Breaking a <i>fragmentainer</i> <var>F</var> effectively splits the <i>fragmentainer</i>
    into two <i>fragmentainers</i> (<var>F<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>F<sub>2</sub></var>).
    The only difference is that the type of break
    between the two pieces <var>F<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>F<sub>2</sub></var>
    is the <a href="#break-types">type of break</a> created
    by the <i>fragmentation context</i> that split <var>F</var>,
    not the type of break normally created by <var>F</var>’s own <i>fragmentation context</i>.
  </p>

<h2 id="breaking-controls">
Controlling Breaks</h2>

  <p>
    The following sections explain how breaks are controlled in a <i>fragmented flow</i>.
    A page/column/region break opportunity between two boxes
    is under the influence of
    the containing block's 'break-inside' property,
    the 'break-after' property of the preceding element,
    and the 'break-before' property of the following element.
    A page/column/region break opportunity between line boxes
    is under the influence of 
    the containing block's 'break-inside', 'widows', and 'orphans' properties.
    A fragmentation break can be
    allowed, forced, or discouraged depending on the values of these properties.
    A forced break overrides any break restrictions acting at that break point.
    In the case of forced page breaks, the author can also specify
    on which page (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#left-right-first">left or right</a>)
    the subsequent content should resume.

  <p>
    See the section on <a href="#breaking-rules">rules for breaking</a>
    for the exact rules on how these properties affect fragmentation.

<h3 id="break-between">
Breaks Between Boxes: the 'break-before' and 'break-after' properties</h3>

  <table class="propdef" summary="property definition">
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>break-before</dfn>, <dfn>break-after</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th>Value:
      <td>auto | avoid | always | any |
          avoid-page | page | left | right | recto | verso |
          avoid-column | column | avoid-region | region
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>auto
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>block-level elements, table row groups, table rows (but see prose)

    <tr>
      <th>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <th>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed&nbsp;value:
      <td>specified value
  </table>

  <p>
    These properties specify page/column/region break behavior
    before/after the generated box.
    The <dfn>forced break values</dfn>
    ''always'', ''any'', ''left'', ''right'', ''recto'', ''verso'', ''page'', ''column'' and ''region''
    create a <a href="#forced-breaks">forced break</a> in the flow
    while the <dfn>avoid break values</dfn>
    ''avoid'', ''avoid-page'', ''avoid-column'' and ''avoid-region''
    indicate that content should be kept together.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since breaks are only allowed between siblings,
    not between a box and its container (see <a href="#possible-breaks">Possible Break Points</a>),
    a 'break-before' value on a first-child box is propagated to its container.
    Likewise a 'break-after' value on a last-child box is propagated to its container.
    (Conflicting values <a href="#forced-breaks">combine</a> as defined below.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Values for 'break-before' and 'break-after' are defined in the sub-sections below.
    User Agents must apply these properties to boxes in the normal flow of the <i>fragmentation root</i>.
    User agents should also apply these properties to floated boxes
    whose containing block is in the normal flow of the root fragmented element.
    User agents may also apply these properties to other boxes.
  </p>

<h4 class="no-num">
Generic Break Values</h4>

  <p>
    These values have an effect regardless of
    the type of fragmented context containing the flow.

  <dl>
    <dt>''auto''
    <dd>
      Neither force nor forbid a break before/after the principle box.
    </dd> 
    <dt>''avoid''
    <dd>
      Avoid a break before/after the principle box.
    </dd> 
    <dt>''always''
    <dd>
      Always force a break
      (of all possible types, through all fragmentation contexts)
      before/after the principle box.
    </dd>
    <dt>''any''
    <dd>
      Force a break of any type, whichever is the type of the deepest fragmentation context,
      before/after the principle box.
    </dd>
  </dl>

<h4 class="no-num">

    </dd>
    <dt>''right''
    <dd>
      Force one or two page breaks before/after the principle box so that the next page is formatted as a right page.
    </dd>
    <dt>''recto''
    <dd>
      Force one or two page breaks before/after the principal box so that
      the next page is formatted as either a left page or a right page,
      whichever is second (according to the page progression) in a page spread.

<h3 id="widows-orphans">
Breaks Between Lines: 'orphans', 'widows'</h3>

  <table class="propdef" summary="property definition">

  </table>

  <p>
    The 'orphans' property specifies the minimum number of line boxes in
    a block container that must be left in a <i>fragment</i> before a
    fragment break. The 'widows' property specifies the minimum number
    of line boxes of a block container that must be left in a
    <i>fragment</i> after a break. Examples of how they are used to
    control fragmentation breaks are given
    <a href="#widows-orphans-example">below</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only positive integers are allowed as values of 'orphans' and 'widows'.
    Negative values and zero are invalid and must cause the declaration to be
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignored</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a block contains fewer lines than the value of 'widows' or 'orphans',
    the rule simply becomes that all lines in the block must be kept together.

Page Break Aliases: the 'page-break-before', 'page-break-after', and 'page-break-inside' properties</h3>

  <p>For compatibility with <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html">CSS Level 2</a>,
  UAs that conform to [[!CSS21]] must alias the
  'page-break-before', 'page-break-after', and 'page-break-inside' properties
  to 'break-before', 'break-after', and 'break-inside'
  by treating the 'page-break-*' properties as shorthands for the 'break-*' properties

<h2 id="breaking-rules">
Rules for Breaking</h2>

  <p>
    A fragmented flow may be broken across fragmentainers at a number of
    <a href="#possible-breaks">possible break points</a>. In the case of
    <a href="#forced-breaks">forced breaks</a>, the UA is required to
    break the flow at that point. In the case of
    <a href="#unforced-breaks">unforced breaks</a>, the UA has to choose
    among the possible breaks that are allowed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some content is not fragmentable, for example many types of
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#replaced-element">replaced elements</a> [[!CSS21]] (such as images or video),
    scrollable elements, or a single line of text content.
    Such content is considered <dfn>monolithic</dfn>:
    it contains no possible break points.
    In addition to any content which is not fragmentable,
    UAs may consider as <i>monolithic</i> any elements with
    'overflow' set to ''auto'' or ''scroll'' and
    any elements with ''overflow: hidden'' and a non-''auto''
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#extent">logical height</a>
    (and no specified maximum logical height).

  <p>
	To guarantee progress, fragmentainers are assumend to have a minimum
	extent of 1px regardless of their used size.
	
<h3 id="possible-breaks">
Possible Break Points</h3>

  <p>
    Fragmentation splits boxes in the block flow dimension.
    In block-and-inline flow, breaks may occur at the following places:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt id="btw-blocks">Class A</dt>
    <dd>
      Between sibling boxes of the following types:
      <dl>
        <dt>Block-parallel Fragmentation</dt>
        <dd>
          When the block flow direction of the siblings' containing block
          is parallel to that of the fragmentation context:
          in-flow block-level boxes,
          a float and an immediately-adjacent in-flow or floated box,
          table row group boxes,
          table row boxes,

  <p class="note">
    There is no inherent prioritization among these classes of break points.
    However, individual break points may be prioritized or de-prioritized
    by using the <a href="#breaking-controls">breaking controls</a>.

  <p id=monolithic-breaking>
    The UA is not required to fragment the contents of <i>monolithic</i> elements,
    and may instead either slice the element's graphical representation
    as necessary to fragment it
    or treat its box as unbreakable and overflow the fragmentainer.
    In both cases it must treat the element as having ''break-inside: avoid'',
    i.e. only slice or overflow at the fragmentainer edge
    if there are no <a href="#possible-breaks">possible break points</a>
    on the fragmentainer.
  </p>

  <p>
    When paginating, if there are no possible break points below the top
    of the page, and not all the content fits, the UA may break anywhere
    in order to avoid losing content off the edge of the page.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Other layout models may add breakpoints to the above classes.
    For example, [[CSS3-FLEXBOX]] adds certain points within a flex formatting context
    to classes A and C.

<h3 id="break-types">
Types of Breaks</h3>

  <p>
    There are different types of breaks in CSS, defined based on the type of
    fragmentainers they span:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>page break</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A break between two <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#page-box">page boxes</a>.
      [[!CSS3PAGE]]
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>spread break</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A break between two page boxes that are not associated with
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#facing-pages">facing pages</a>.
      A spread break is always also a page break.
      [[!CSS3PAGE]]
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>column break</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A break between two <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/#column-box">column boxes</a>.
      Note that if the column boxes are on different pages, then the break is
      also a <i>page break</i>.
      Similarly, if the column boxes are in different regions,
      then the break is also a <i>region break</i>.
      [[!CSS3COL]]
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>region break</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A break between two <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/#regions">regions</a>.
      Note that if the region boxes are on different pages, then the break is
      also a <i>page break</i>.
      [[!CSS3-REGIONS]]
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p class="note">
    A fifth type of break is the <dfn>line break</dfn>, which is a break between
    two <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#line-box">line boxes</a>.
    These are not covered in this specification; see [[!CSS21]] [[CSS3TEXT]].
  </p>

<h3 id="forced-breaks">
Forced Breaks</h3>

  <p>
    A <dfn>forced break</dfn> is one explicitly indicated by the style sheet author.
    A <i>forced break</i> occurs at a <a href="#btw-blocks">class A break point</a> if,
    among the 'break-after' properties specified on or propagated to the earlier sibling box
    and the 'break-before' properties specified on or propagated to the later sibling box
    there is at least one with a <i>forced break value</i>.
    (Thus a <i>forced break value</i> effectively overrides any <i>avoid break value</i>
    that also applies at that break point.)
  </p>
  <p>
    When multiple <i>forced break values</i> apply to a single break point,
    they combine such that all types of break are honored.
    When ''left'', ''right'', ''recto'', and/or ''verso'' are combined,
    the value specified on the latest element in the flow wins.
  </p>
  <p class="note">
    A page break must also occur at a <a href="#btw-blocks">class A break point</a>
    if the last line box above this margin and the first one below it do not have the
    same value for 'page'. See [[!CSS3PAGE]]
  </p>
  <p>
    When a forced break occurs,
    it forces ensuing content into the next fragmentainer of the type associated with the break,
    breaking through as many fragmentation contexts as necessary
    until the specified break types are all satisfied.
    If the forced break is not contained within a matching type of fragmentation context,
    then the forced break has no effect.

<h3 id="unforced-breaks">
Unforced Breaks</h3>

  <p>
    While <a href="#breaking-controls">breaking controls</a> can force breaks,
    they can also discourage them.
    An <dfn>unforced break</dfn> is one that is inserted automatically by the UA
    in order to prevent content from overflowing the <i>fragmentainer</i>.
    The following rules control whether unforced breaking
    at a <a href="#possible-breaks">possible break point</a> is allowed:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Rule 1</dt>
    <dd>
      A fragmented flow may break at a <a href="#btw-blocks">class A break point</a> only if
      all the 'break-after' and 'break-before' values applicable to this
      break point allow it, which is when at least one of them forces a
      break or when all of them are ''auto''.
    </dd>
    <dt>Rule 2</dt>
    <dd>
      However, if all of them are ''auto'' and a common ancestor of all
      the elements has a 'break-inside' value of ''avoid'', then breaking
      here is not allowed.
    </dd>
    <dt>Rule 3</dt>
    <dd>
      Breaking at a <a href="#btw-lines">class B break point</a> is allowed only if the number
      of line boxes between the break and the start of the enclosing block
      box is the value of 'orphans' or more, and the number of line boxes
      between the break and the end of the box is the value of 'widows' or more.
    </dd>
    <dt>Rule 4</dt>
    <dd>
      Additionally, breaking at <a href="#btw-blocks">class B</a> or
      <a href="#end-block">class C</a> break points
      is allowed only if the 'break-inside' property of all ancestors is ''auto''.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    If the above doesn't provide enough break points to keep content from
    overflowing the page boxes, then rules 1, 2 and 4 are dropped in order
    to find additional breakpoints.
    In this case the UA may use the ''avoid''s that are in effect at those
    points to weigh the appropriateness of the new breakpoints; however,
    this specification does not suggest a precise algorithm.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that still does not lead to sufficient break points, rule 3 is
    dropped as well, to find still more break points.
  </p>

<h3 id="best-breaks">
Optimizing Unforced Breaks</h3>

  <p>While CSS3 requires that a fragmented flow must break at allowed
    break points in order to avoid overflowing the fragmentainers in its
    fragmentation context, it does not define whether content breaks
    at a particular <a href="#unforced-breaks">allowed break</a>.
    However, it is recommended that user agents observe the following
    guidelines (while recognizing that they are sometimes contradictory):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Break as few times as possible.</li>
    <li>Make all fragmentainers that don't end with a forced break appear
      to be equally filled with content.</li>
    <li>Avoid breaking inside a replaced element.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example" id="widows-orphans-example">
    <p>
      Suppose, for example, that the style sheet contains ''orphans : 4'',
      ''widows : 2'', and there is space for 20 lines (line boxes) available
      at the bottom of the current page, and the next block in normal flow
      is considered for placement:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the block contains 20 line boxes or fewer, it should be placed
        on the current page.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the block contains 21 or 22 line boxes, the second fragment of
        the paragraph must not violate the 'widows' constraint, and so
        the second fragment must contain at least two line boxes;
        likewise the first fragment must contain at least four line boxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the block contains 23 line boxes or more, the first fragment should
        contain 20 lines and the second fragment the remaining lines. But if
        any fragment of the block is placed on the current page, that fragment
        must contain at least four line boxes and the second fragment at least
        two line boxes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now suppose that 'orphans' is ''10'', 'widows' is ''20'', and there
      are 8 lines available at the bottom of the current page:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the block contains 8 lines or fewer, it should be placed
        on the current page.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the block contains 9 lines or more, it must NOT be split
        (that would violate the 'orphans' constraint), so it must
        move as a block to the next page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

<h2 id="breaking-boxes">
Box Model for Breaking</h2>

  <p class="note">
    The sizing terminology used in this section is defined in [[CSS3-SIZING]].
  </p>

<h3 id="varying-size-boxes">
Breaking into Varying-size Fragmentainers</h3>

  <p>
    When a flow is fragmented into varying-size fragmentainers, the following
    rules are observed for adapting layout:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Intrinsic sizes are calculated and maintained across the entire element.
      Where an initial containing block size is needed to resolve an intrinsic 
      size, assume the size of the first fragmentainer defining a fragmentation context.
    </li>
    <li>
      Layout is performed per-fragmentainer, with each fragmentainer continuing
      progress from the breakpoint on the previous, but recalculating sizes
      and positions using its own size as if the entire element were fragmented
      across fragmentainers of this size. Progress is measured in percentages
      (not absolute lengths) of used/remaining fragmentainer extent and in amount of
      used/remaining content.
      However, when laying out <i>monolithic</i> elements,
      the UA may instead maintain a consistent measure and resolved extent
      across fragmentainers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fragments of boxes that began on a previous fragmentainer must obey
      placement rules with the additional constraint that fragments must
      not be positioned above the before edge of the fragmentainer.
      If this results in a box's continuation fragment
      shifting away from the before edge of the fragmentainer, then
      ''box-decoration-break: clone'', if specified, wraps the fragment
      with the box's margin in addition to its padding and border.
      <div class="figure">

        </div>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    Since document order of elements doesn't change during fragmentation,
    fragments are processed following the same rules that apply to continuous
    media. In particular, the order of floats is preserved across all 
    fragments and follows the same rules as defined in CSS 2.1 9.5.
  </p>

  <p>Below are listed (informatively) some implications of these rules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Boxes (including tables) fullfilling layout constraints at their
      <i>fill-available</i> or percentage-based size may change measure
      across pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Boxes (including tables) fulfilling layout constraints at their
      <i>min-content</i>, <i>max-content</i>, or absolute-length size
      will maintain their measure across pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      A block-level continuation fragment may be placed below the top of
      the page if, e.g. it establishes a block formatting context and
      is placed beside a float and both it and the float continue onto
      a narrower page that is too narrow to hold both of them side-by-side.
    </li>
    <li>
      An element adjacent to a preceding float on one page may wind up above
      the float's continuation on the next page if,
      e.g. that float is pushed down because
      it no longer fits side-by-side with an earlier float
      that also continues onto this narrower page.
    </li>
    <li>
      A left float may appear on a page <em>before</em>
      the remaining fragments of a preceding right float
      if that right float does not fit on the earlier page.
      However another right float will be forced down until
      the preceding right float's remaining fragment can be placed.
  </ul>

  <div class="example">
    <p>Here is an example that shows the use of percentage-based progress:
    Suppose we have an absolutely-positioned element that is positioned
    ''top: calc(150% + 30px)'' and has ''height: calc(100% - 10px)''. If
    it is placed into a paginated context with a first page height of 400px,
    a second page of 200px, and a third page of 600px, its layout progresses
    as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>First, the top position is resolved against the height of the first page.
      This results in 630px. Since the first page has a height of only 400px, layout
      moves to the second page, recording progress of 400/630 = 63.49% with
      36.51% left to go.
      <li>Now on the second page, the top position is again resolved, this
      time against the height of the second page. This results in 330px. The 
      remaining 36.51% of progress thus resolves to 120.5px, placing the top edge of
      the element 120.5px down the second page.
      <li>Now the height is resolved against the second page; it resolves
      to 190px. Since there are only 79.5px left on the page, layout moves
      to the third page, recording progress of 79.5/190 = 41.84%, with 58.16%
      left to go.
      <li>On the third page, the height resolves to 590px. The remaining
      48.16% of progress thus resolves to 246.9px, which fits on this page
      and completes the element.
    </ul>
  </div>

<h3 id="break-margins">
Adjoining Margins at Breaks</h3>

  <p>
    When an unforced break occurs between block-level boxes,
    any margins adjoining the break truncate to the <i>remaining fragmentainer extent</i>.
    When a forced break occurs there, adjoining margins before the break are truncated,
    but margins after the break are preserved.
  </p>

<h3 id="box-splitting">
Splitting Boxes</h3>

  <p>
    When a box breaks,
    its content box extends to fill any <i>remaining fragmentainer extent</i>
    (leaving room for any margins/borders/padding applied by ''box-decoration-break: clone'')
    before the content resumes on the next <i>fragmentainer</i>.
    (A <i>fragmentation break</i> that pushes content to the next <i>fragmentainer</i>
     effectively increases the extent of a box's contents.)

  <p class="note">
    The extra extent contributed by fragmenting the box
    (i.e. the distance from the break point to the edge of the <i>fragmentainer</i>)
    contributes progress towards any specified limits on the box's extent.

  <div class="figure">

    <dd>
      Each box fragment is independently wrapped with the border and padding.
      The 'border-radius' and 'border-image' and 'box-shadow', if any,
      are applied to each fragment independently.
      The background is drawn independently in each fragment of the element.
      A no-repeat background image will thus be rendered once in each fragment of the element.
    </dd>

    <dt><dfn>''slice''</dfn>
    <dd>
      <p>No border and no padding are inserted at a break;

      'border-radius' does not apply to its corners;
      and backgrounds and the 'border-image' are rendered for the whole box
      as if the box were unbroken.
      The effect is as though the element were rendered with no breaks present,
      and then sliced by the breaks afterward.

  to split into non-contiguous fragments. Otherwise such breaks are
  always handled as ''slice''.

  <p class=note>
  For inline elements, which side of a fragment is considered the broken edge
  is determined by the parent element's inline progression direction.
  For example, if an inline element whose parent has ''direction: rtl''
  breaks across two lines, the <em>left</em> edge of the fragment on
  the first line will be the broken edge. (Note in particular that
  neither the element's own 'direction' nor its containing block's
  'direction' is used.) See [[CSS3-WRITING-MODES]].

<h4 id="joining-boxes">
Joining Boxes for ''slice''</h4>

  <p>For ''box-decoration: slice'', backgrounds (and 'border-image')
  are drawn as if applied to a composite box
  consisting of all of the box's fragments

  This theoretical assembly occurs after the element has been laid out

      First, fragments on the same line are connected in visual order.
      Then, fragments on subsequent lines are ordered
      according to the element's <i>inline base direction</i>
      and aligned on the element's dominant baseline.
      For example, in a left-to-right containing block ('direction' is ''ltr''),
      the first fragment is the leftmost fragment on the first line
      and fragments from subsequent lines are put to the right of it.
      In a right-to-left containing block,
      the first fragment is the rightmost on the first line
      and subsequent fragments are put to the left of it.</p>

  <p>If the box fragments have different widths
  (heights, if the fragments are joined horizontally),
  then each piece draws its portion of the background
  assuming that the whole element has the same width (height) as this piece.
  However, if the used height (width) of an image is derived from the width (height) of the box,
  then it is calculated using the widest fragment's width
  and maintained as a fixed size.
  This ensures that right-aligned images stay aligned to the right edge,
  left-aligned images stay aligned to the left edge,
  centered images stay centered,
  and stretched images cover the background area as intended
  while preserving continuity across fragments.

<h3 id="transforms">
Transforms, Positioning, and Pagination</h3>

  <p>
    Fragmentation interacts with layout, and thus occurs <em>before</em>
    relative positioning [[!CSS21]], transforms [[!CSS3-TRANSFORMS]],
    and any other graphical effects.
    Such effects are applied per fragment:
    for example, rotation applied to a fragmented box
    will calculate a rotation origin for each fragment
    and independently rotate that fragment around its origin.
    However, the separation and transfer of page boxes <em>should</em> occur last;
    thus a transformed fragment that spans pages <em>should</em>
    be sliced at the page breaks and print in its entirety
    rather than being clipped by its originating page.

  <p class="issue">
    There's an issue of how to handle fragments consisting entirely of overflowing content.
    See <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Dec/0471.html">discussion</a>.

  <p>
    Absolute positioning affects layout and thus interacts with fragmentation.
    Both the coordinate system and absolutely-positioned boxes belonging to a containing block
    will fragment across pages in the same fragmentation flow as the containing block.

  <p>
    UAs are not required to correctly position boxes that span a <i>fragmentation break</i>
    and whose <i>before edge</i> position depends on where the box's content fragments.
    UAs with memory constraints that prevent them from manipulating an entire document in memory
    are not required to correctly position absolutely-positioned elements
    that end up on a previously-rendered page.

<h2 id="conformance">
Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>
  <p>
    Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions
    and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “must”, “must NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”,
    “SHALL NOT”, “should”, “should NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “may”, and “OPTIONAL” in the
    normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
    However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in
    this specification.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of the text of this specification is normative except sections explicitly marked
    as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example” or are
    set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>, like this:
  </p>
  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>
  <p>
      Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the normative
      text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:
  </p>
  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>
  <h3 id="conformance-classes">Conformance Classes</h3>
  <p>Conformance to CSS Fragmentation is defined for three conformance classes:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS style sheet</a>.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a> that interprets
      the semantics of a style sheet and renders documents that use them.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a> that writes
      a style sheet.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    A style sheet is conformant to CSS Fragmentation if all of its declarations
    that use properties defined in this module have values that are valid according
    to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each property as given
    in this module.
  </p>
  <p>
    A renderer is conformant to CSS Fragmentation if, in addition to interpreting
    the style sheet as defined by the appropriate specifications, it supports all the
    features defined by CSS Fragmentation by parsing them correctly and rendering
    the document accordingly. However, the inability of a UA to correctly render a document
    due to limitations of the device does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example,
    a UA is not required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  </p>
  <p>
    An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Fragmentation if it writes style
    sheets that are syntactically correct according to the generic CSS grammar and the
    individual grammars of each feature in this module, and meet all other conformance
    requirements of style sheets as described in this module.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>
    So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to assign fallback
    values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong> treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">
        ignore as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
    and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of support. In
    particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively ignore unsupported
    component values and honor supported values in a single multi-value property declaration:
    if any value is considered invalid (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires
    that the entire declaration be ignored.
  </p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>
    To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification reserves a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed syntax</a>
    for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.</p>
  <p>
    Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage in the W3C
    process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered experimental. The CSS
    Working Group recommends that implementations use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such
    features, including those in W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with
    future changes in the draft.
  </p>

<h3 id="testing">
Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>
    Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage, non-experimental
    implementations are possible, and implementors should release an unprefixed implementation
    of any CR-level feature they can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according
    to spec.
  </p>
  <p>
    To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across implementations, the
    CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental CSS renderers submit an implementation
    report (and, if necessary, the testcases used for that implementation report) to
    the W3C before releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
    submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS Working Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports can be found
    from on the CSS Working Group's website at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">
        http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>. Questions should be directed to the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">
            public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a> mailing list.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p>
    For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation, there must be
    at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature. Each feature
    may be implemented by a different set of products, there is no requirement that
    all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion,
    we define the following terms:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>independent </dt>
    <dd>
      each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse,
      or derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code
      that have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from
      this requirement.</dd>
    <dt>interoperable</dt>
    <dd>
      passing the respective test case(s) in the official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation
      is not a Web browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test suite
      should have an equivalent test created if such a user agent (UA) is to be used to
      claim interoperability. In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
      then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those equivalent
      tests in the same way for the purpose of interoperability. The equivalent tests
      must be made publicly available for the purposes of peer review.
    </dd>
    <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>
      a user agent which:
      <ol class="inline">
      <li>implements the specification.</li>
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may be a shipping product
        or other publicly available version (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly
        build”). Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the feature(s) for
        a period of at least one month in order to demonstrate stability.</li>
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed to pass the test suite
        and is not intended for normal usage going forward).</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least six months.
  </p>

<h2 class="no-num" id="changes">
Changes</h2>

  <p>The following significant changes were made since the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-css3-break-20120823/">29 August 2012 Working Draft</a>:

  <ul>
    <li>Added definition of 'box-decoration-break' (moved from [[CSS3BG]])
      and defined better handling of aspect-ratio-sized images in variable-sized fragments.
    <li>Added ''any'' value to 'break-before' and 'break-after'.
    <li>Defined that boxes <a href="#box-splitting">extend to the bottom of the page</a> when broken.
    <li>Defined breaking of <a href="#transforms">transformed/positioned content</a>.
    <li>Defined 1px minimum extent of fragmentainers to ensure progress.
    <li>Clarified fragmentation of <a href="#paraparal-flows">parallel flows</a>.
    <li>Defined handling of overflowing content (as parallel content).
    <li>Clarified <a href="#varying-size-boxes">float fragmentation</a> in varying-size fragmentainers.
    <li>Various other clarifications.
  </ul>
