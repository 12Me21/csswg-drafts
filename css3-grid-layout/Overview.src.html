	<p>
		This CSS module defines a two-dimensional grid-based layout system,
		optimized for user interface design.
		In the grid layout model,
		the children of a grid container can be positioned into arbitrary slots in a flexible or fixed predefined layout grid.

<h2 id='intro'>
Introduction and Overview</h2>

	<p>
		Grid layout contains features targeted at web application authors.
		The grid can be used to achieve many different layouts.
		It excels at dividing up space for major regions of an application,
		or defining the relationship in terms of size, position, and layer
		between parts of a control built from HTML primitives.

	<p>
		Like tables,
		grid layout enables an author to align elements into columns and rows,
		but unlike tables,
		grid layout doesn't have content structure,
		and thus enables a wide variety of layouts not possible with tables.
		For example, the children of a grid container can position themselves
		such that they overlap and layer similar to positioned elements.

	<p>
		In addition, the absence of content structure in grid layout helps to manage changes to layout
		by using fluid and source order independent layout techniques.
		By combining media queries with the CSS properties that control layout of the grid container and its children,
		authors can adapt their layout to changes in device form factors, orientation, and available space,
		without needing to alter the semantic nature of their content.

	<p class="issue">
		A common use of design grids is to allow content to flow normally, but "snap" components to grid lines based on their normal flow position. Consider adding a grid placement algorithm based on such relative positioning. Note that this is a non-trivial issue as it impacts the static flow of content. In addition, the grid's algorithm currently depends on knowing the position of every grid item in advance to determine the size of its tracks; when snapping to grid lines, however, the line to which the grid item will snap is influenced by both the item's size and the size of tracks the item covers.

Background and Motivation</h3>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<img class="figure" alt="Image: Application layout example requiring horizontal and vertical alignment." src="images/basic-form.png" />
		<p class="caption">Application layout example requiring horizontal and vertical alignment.
	</div>

	<p>
		As websites evolved from simple documents into complex, interactive applications,
		tools for document layout, e.g. floats,
		were not necessarily well suited for application layout.
		By using a combination of tables, JavaScript, or careful measurements on floated elements,
		authors discovered workarounds to achieve desired layouts.
		Layouts that adapted to the available space were often brittle
		and resulted in counter-intuitive behavior as space became constrained.
		As an alternative, authors of many web applications opted for a fixed layout
		that cannot take advantage of changes in the available rendering space on a screen.

	<p>
		The capabilities of grid layout address these problems.
		It provides a mechanism for authors to divide available space for layout into columns and rows
		using a set of predictable sizing behaviors.
		Authors can then precisely position and size the building block elements of their application
		by into <i>grid areas</i> defined by these columns and rows.
		Figure 1 illustrates a basic layout which can be achieved with grid layout.

Adapting Layouts to Available Space</h3>

		<p class="caption">

	</div>

	<p>
		Grid layout can be used to intelligently reflow elements within a webpage.
		Figure 2 represents a game with five major areas in the layout:
		the game title, stats area, game board, score area, and control area.
		The author's intent is to divide the space for the game such that:

	<ul>
		<li>
			The stats area always appears immediately under the game title.
		<li>
			The game board appears to the right of the stats and title.
		<li>
			The top of the game title and the game board should always align.
		<li>
			The bottom of the game board and the stats area align when the game has reached its minimum height,
			but otherwise the game board will stretch to take advantage of all the screen real-estate available to it.
		<li>
			The score area should align into the column created by the game and stats area,
			while the controls are centered under the board.
	</ul>

	<p>
		As an alternative to using script to control the absolute position, width, and height of all elements,
		the author can use grid layout,
		as shown in Figure 3.
		The following example shows how an author might achieve all the sizing, placement, and alignment rules declaratively.

	<p>
		Note that there are multiple ways to specify the structure of the grid
		and to position and size <i>grid items</i>,
		each optimized for different scenarios.
		This example illustrates one that an author may use to define the position and space for each <i>grid item</i>
		using the 'grid-definition-rows' and 'grid-definition-columns' properties on the <i>grid container</i>,
		and the 'grid-row-position', 'grid-column-position', 'grid-row-span' and 'grid-column-span' properties on each <i>grid item</i>.


	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		display: grid;

		/* Two columns: the first sized to content, the second receives the remaining space,   */
		/* but is never smaller than the minimum size of the board or the game controls, which */
		/* occupy this column. */
		grid-column-definition: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr);

		/* Three rows: the first and last sized to content, the middle row receives the        */
		/* remaining space, but is never smaller than the minimum height of the board or stats */
		/* areas. */
		grid-row-definition: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr) auto
	}

	/* Each part of the game is positioned between grid lines by referencing the starting grid */
	/* line and then specifying, if more than one, the number of rows or columns spanned to    */
	/* determine the ending grid line, which establishes bounds for the part. */
	#title    { grid-column-position: 1; grid-row-position: 1 }
	#score    { grid-column-position: 1; grid-row-position: 3 }
	#stats    { grid-column-position: 1; grid-row-position: 2; justify-self: start }
	#board    { grid-column-position: 2; grid-row-position: 1; grid-row-span: 2 }
	#controls { grid-column-position: 2; grid-row-position: 3; align-self: center }
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="grid">
	&lt;div id="title">Game Title&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="score">Score&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="stats">Stats&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="board">Board&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="controls">Controls&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre>

<h3 id='source-independence'>
Source Independence</h3>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<p>
			<img alt="Image: An arrangement suitable for portrait orientation." src="images/game-portrait.png" />

		<p class="caption">An arrangement suitable for ''portrait'' orientation.
	</div>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<p>
			<img alt="Image: An arrangement suitable for landscape orientation." src="images/game-landscape.png" />

		<p class="caption">An arrangement suitable for ''landscape'' orientation.
	</div>

	<p>
		Continuing the prior example,
		the author also wants the game to adapt to the space available on traditional computer monitors, handheld devices, or tablet computers.
		Also, the game should optimize the placement of the components when viewed either in landscape or portrait orientation (Figures 4 and 5).
		By combining grid layout with media queries,
		the author is able to use the same semantic markup,
		but rearrange the layout of elements independent of their source order,
		to achieve the desired layout in both orientations.

	<p>
		The following example leverages grid layout&rsquo;s ability to name the space which will be occupied by a <i>grid item</i>.
		This allows the author to avoid rewriting rules for <i>grid items</i>
		as the grid&rsquo;s definition changes.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
	@media (orientation: portrait) {
		#grid {
			display: grid;

			/* The rows, columns and areas of the grid are defined visually using the */
			/* grid-template property.  Each string is a row, and each word an area.  */
			/* The number of words in a string determines the number of               */
			/* columns. Note the number of words in each string must be identical.    */
			grid-template: "title stats"
						   "score stats"
						   "board board"
						   "ctrls ctrls";

			/* Columns and rows created with the template property can be assigned a sizing */
			/* function with the grid-definition-columns and grid-definition-rows properties. */
			grid-definition-columns: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr);
			grid-definition-rows: auto auto minmax(min-content, 1fr) auto
		}
	}

	@media (orientation: landscape) {
		#grid {
			display: grid;

			/* Again the template property defines areas of the same name, but this time */
			/* positioned differently to better suit a landscape orientation.            */
			grid-template: "title board"
						   "stats board"
						   "score ctrls";

			grid-definition-columns: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr);
			grid-definition-rows: auto minmax(min-content, 1fr) auto
		}
	}

	/* The grid-area property places a grid item into named region (area) of the grid. */
	#title    { grid-area: title }
	#score    { grid-area: score }
	#stats    { grid-area: stats }
	#board    { grid-area: board }
	#controls { grid-area: ctrls }
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="grid">
	&lt;div id="title">Game Title&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="score">Score&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="stats">Stats&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="board">Board&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="controls">Controls&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre>


<h3 id='grid-layering-of-elements'>
Grid Layering of Elements</h3>

	<div class="sidefigure">
		<p>
			<img alt="Image: A control composed of layered HTML elements." src="images/control-layering-and-alignment.png" />

		<p class="caption">A control composed of layered HTML elements.
	</div>

	<p>
		In the example shown in Figure 6,
		the author is creating a custom slider control.
		The control has six parts.
		The lower and upper labels align to the left and right edges of the control.
		The track of the slider spans the area between the labels.
		The lower and upper fill parts touch beneath the thumb,
		and the thumb is a fixed width and height that can be moved along the track
		by updating the two fraction-sized columns.

	<p>
		Prior to the introduction of grid layout,
		the author would have likely used absolute positioning to control the top and left coordinates,
		along with the width and height of each HTML element that comprises the control.
		By leveraging grid layout,
		the author can instead limit script usage to handling mouse events on the thumb,
		which snaps to various positions along the track
		as the 'grid-definition-columns' property of the <i>grid container</i> is updated.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		display: grid;

		/* The grid-definition-columns and rows properties also support naming grid lines */
		/* which can then be used to position grid items.  The line names are assigned on    */
		/* either side of a column or row sizing function where the line would logically exist. */
		grid-definition-columns:
			"start"        auto
			"track-start"  0.5fr
			"thumb-start"  auto
			"fill-split"   auto
			"thumb-end"    0.5fr
			"track-end"    auto
			"end";
	}

	/* grid-column and grid-row accept a starting and optional ending line. */
	/* Below the lines are referred to by name. Beyond any semantic advantage, the names  */
	/* also allow the author to avoid renumbering the grid-row-position and      */
	/* column properties of the grid items.  This is similar to the concept demonstrated in the */
	/* prior example with the grid-template property during orientation changes, but    */
	/* grid lines can also work with layered grid items that have overlapping areas of    */
	/* different shapes like the thumb and track parts  in this example. */
	#lower-label { grid-column: "start" }
	#track       { grid-column: "track-start" "track-end"; align-self: center }
	#upper-label { grid-column: "track-end"; }

	/* Fill parts are drawn above the track so set z-index to 5. */
	#lower-fill  { grid-column: "track-start" "fill-split"; align-self: center; z-index: 5 }
	#upper-fill  { grid-column: "fill-split" "track-end"; align-self: center; z-index: 5 }

	/* Thumb is the topmost part; assign it the highest z-index value. */
	#thumb       { grid-column: "thumb-start" "thumb-end"; z-index: 10 }
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="grid">
	&lt;div id="lower-label">Lower Label&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="upper-label">Upper Label&lt;/div>
	&lt;div id="track">Track&lt;/div>

Grid Layout Concepts and Terminology</h2>

	<p>
		In <dfn>grid layout</dfn>,
		the content of a <i>grid container</i> is laid out
		by positioning and aligning it into a <i>grid</i>.
		The <dfn>grid</dfn> is an intersecting set of horizontal and vertical <i>grid lines</i>
		that divides the <i>grid container</i>&rsquo;s space into <i>grid areas</i>,
		into which <i>grid items</i> (representing the <i>grid container</i>&rsquo;s content) can be placed.  
		There are two sets of <i>grid lines</i>: 
		one set defining <dfn title="grid column | column">columns</dfn>
		that run along the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#block-axis">block axis</a>,
		and an orthogonal set defining <dfn title="grid row | row">rows</dfn>
		along the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#inline-axis">inline axis</a>.

		<p class="caption">Grid lines: Three in the block axis and four in the inline axis.
	</div>

<h3 id="grid-track-concept">
Grid Tracks</h3>

	<p>
		<dfn>Grid track</dfn> is a generic term for a <i>grid column</i> or <i>grid row</i>&mdash;in
		other words, it is the space between two adjacent <i>grid lines</i>.
		Each <i>grid track</i> is assigned a sizing function,
		which controls how wide or tall the column or row may grow,
		and thus how far apart its bounding <i>grid lines</i> are.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			In the following example there are two columns and three rows.
			The first column is fixed at 150px.
			The second column uses fractional sizing, which is a function of the unassigned space in the Grid,
			and thus will vary as the width of the <i>grid container</i> changes.
			If the used width of the <i>grid container</i> is 200px, then the second column 50px wide.
			If the used width of the <i>grid element</i> is 100px, then the second column is 0px
			and any content positioned in the column will overflow the <i>grid container</i>.

		<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-definition-columns: 150px 1fr; /* two columns */
		grid-definition-rows: 50px 1fr 50px /* three rows  */
	}
&lt;/style></pre>
	</div>

<h3 id="grid-line-concept">
Grid Lines</h3>

	<p>
		<dfn id='grid-line' title='grid line'>Grid lines</dfn> are the horizontal and vertical dividing lines of the <i>grid</i>.
		They can be referred to by numerical index,
		or by an author-specified name.
		A <i>grid item</i> references the <i>grid lines</i> to determine its position within the <i>grid</i>
		using the <a href="#placement">grid-placement properties</a>.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			The following two examples create three column <i>grid lines</i> and four row <i>grid lines</i>.
			The first example demonstrates how an author would position a <i>grid item</i> using <i>grid line</i> numbers.
			The second example uses explicitly named <i>grid lines</i>.

		<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-definition-columns: 150px 1fr;
    grid-definition-rows: 50px 1fr 50px
  }

  #item1 { grid-column: 2;
           grid-start: 1; grid-end: 1; }
&lt;/style></pre>

    <pre>
&lt;style type="text/css">
  /* equivalent layout to the prior example, but using named lines */
  #grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-definition-columns: 150px "item1-start" 1fr "item1-end";
    grid-definition-rows: "item1-start" 50px 1fr 50px "item1-end"
  }

  #item1 {
    grid-column: "item1-start" "item1-end";
    grid-row: "item1-start" "item1-end"
  }
&lt;/style></pre>
	</div>


<h3 id="grid-area-concept">
Grid Areas</h3>

	<p>
		A <dfn>grid area</dfn> is the logical space used to lay out one or more <i>grid items</i>.
		It is bound by four <i>grid lines</i>, one on each side of the <i>grid area</i>,
		and participates in the sizing of the <i>grid tracks</i> it intersects.
		A <i>grid area</i> can be named explicitly using the 'grid-template' property of the <i>grid container</i>,
		or referenced implicitly by its bounding <i>grid lines</i>.
		A <i>grid item</i> is assigned to a <i>grid area</i>
		using the <a href="#placement">grid-placement properties</a>.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
  /* using the template syntax */
  #grid  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: ". a"
                 "b a"
                 ". a";
  grid-definition-columns: 150px 1fr;
  grid-definition-rows: 50px 1fr 50px
  }

  #item1 { grid-area: a }
  #item2 { grid-area: b }
  #item3 { grid-area: b }

  /* Align items 2 and 3 at different points in the Grid Area "b".  */
  /* By default, Grid Items are stretched to fit their Grid Area    */
  /* and these items would layer one over the other. */
  #item2 { align-self: head }
  #item3 { justify-self: end; align-self: foot }
&lt;/style></pre>

	<p>
		A <i>grid item</i>&rsquo;s <i>grid area</i> forms the containing block into which it is laid out.
		Percentage lengths specified on a <i>grid item</i> resolve against this containing block.
		Percentages specified for 'margin-top', 'padding-top', 'margin-bottom', and 'padding-bottom' on a <i>grid item</i>
		resolve against the height of its containing block, 
		rather than the width (as for blocks).

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> placed into the same <i>grid area</i> do not directly affect each other's layout.
		Indirectly, a <i>grid item</i> can affect the position of a <i>grid line</i> in a column or row that uses a contents-based relative size,
		which in turn can affect the position or size of another <i>grid item</i>.

	<p>
		The baseline of an inline <i>Grid element</i> is the bottom edge of the margin box.

<h3>Subgrids: the ''subgrid'' 'display' value</h3>

	<p class="issue">
		This is a proposal to address the alignment of sub-items across grid items

	<p>
		A grid item can itself be a grid element by giving it ''display: grid''; in this case the layout of its contents will be independent of the layout of the grid it participates in.

	<p>
		In some cases it might be necessary for the contents of multiple grid items to align to each other; in this case ''display: subgrid'' can be used. A grid item with ''display: subgrid'' behaves just like one with ''display: grid'' except that:
	<ul>
		<li>
			The 'grid-column-definition' and 'grid-row-definition' properties do not apply.
			Instead the number of explicit tracks is given by its 'grid-column-span' and 'grid-row-span' properties,
			and their sizes are determined by the parent grid.
		<li>
			The used 'grid-column-span' and 'grid-row-span' of the item is determined by the number of grid rows and grid columns it contains.
		<li>
			Its own grid items participate in the sizing of its parent grid and are aligned to it.
			In this process, the sum of the item's margin, padding, and borders are applied as an extra layer of margin to the items at those edges.
	</ul>

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			For example, suppose we have a form consisting of a list of inputs with labels:
		<pre>
&lt;ul>
  &lt;li>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input name=fn>
  &lt;li>&lt;label>Address:&lt;/label> &lt;input name=address>
  &lt;li>&lt;label>Phone:&lt;/label> &lt;input name=phone>
&lt;/ul></pre>

		<p>
			We want the labels and inputs to align, and we want to style each list item with a border.
			This can be accomplished with subgrid layout:

		<pre>
ul {
	display: grid;
	grid-auto-flow: rows;
	grid-definition-columns: auto 1fr;
}

<h2>Grid Items</h2>

	<p>
		The contents of a <i>grid element</i> consists of zero or more <dfn id="grid-item">grid item</dfn>s:
		each child of a <i>grid element</i>
		becomes a <i>grid item</i>,
		and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a <i>grid element</i>
		is wrapped in an anonymous <i>grid item</i>.
		However, an anonymous grid item that contains only
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#white-space-prop">white space</a>
		is not rendered, as if it were ''display:none''.

	<div class="issue">
		<p>
			This will place all of the contents of the grid on top of each other in slot 1 1.
			Alternatives:

		<ul>
			<li>Turn on auto-positioning by default (see 'grid-auto-flow').
			<li>Place all unpositioned elements in the grid into an anonymous grid item in slot 1 1.
			<li>Place all unpositioned elements in the grid into an anonymous grid item whose position is given by a "*" template slot,
			else is in slot 1 1.
			<li>Same as the previous, except if there is no "*" template slot, auto-position the children.
		</ul>
	</div>

	<p>
		A <i>grid item</i> establishes a new formatting context for its contents.
		The type of this formatting context is determined by its 'display' value, as usual.
		The computed 'display' of a <i>grid item</i>
		is determined by applying the table in
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Chapter 9.7</a>.
		However, grid items are grid-level boxes, not block-level boxes:
		they participate in the <i>grid element</i>&rsquo;s formatting context,
		not in a block formatting context.

	<div class="example">
		<p>
			Examples of grid items:
		<pre>
&lt;div style="display:grid">

	&lt;!-- grid item: block child -->
	&lt;div id="item1">block&lt;/div>

	&lt;!-- grid item: floated element; floating is ignored -->
	&lt;div id="item2" style="float: left;">float&lt;/div>

	&lt;!-- grid item: anonymous block box around inline content -->
	anonymous item 3

	&lt;!-- grid item: inline child -->
	&lt;span>
		item 4
		&lt;!-- grid items do not split around blocks -->
		&lt;div id=not-an-item>item 4&lt;/div>
		item 4
	&lt;/span>
&lt;/div></pre>
	</div>

	<p>
		Some values of 'display' trigger the generation of anonymous boxes.
		For example, a misparented ''table-cell'' child is fixed up
		by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#anonymous-boxes">generating anonymous ''table'' and ''table-row'' elements</a> around it. [[!CSS21]]
		This fixup must occur <em>before</em> a grid element's children are promoted to <i>grid items</i>.
		For example, given two contiguous child elements with ''display:table-cell'',
		an anonymous table wrapper box around them becomes the <i>grid item</i>.

	<p class='note'>
		Future display types may generate anonymous containers (e.g. ruby) or otherwise mangle the box tree (e.g. run-ins).
		It is intended that grid item determination run after these operations.


<h3>Non-children Grid Items</h3>

	<p class="issue">
		This is a proposal to create the ability to have descendants of a grid item participate in a grid layout,
		similar to the behavior defined by the Template Layout module.

	<p>
		A descendant of the grid can be pulled out of flow and participate directly in the grid
		by assigning it ''position: grid''.
		An element with ''position: grid'' is pulled out of flow and participates as a grid item
		belonging to the first ancestor with ''display: grid''.
		If the element is positioned using named lines or slots,
		it belongs to the first ancestor with ''display: grid'' that has all of the corresponding named lines/slots.
		If no such ancestor exists, the item remains in flow.

	<p class="issue">
		Alternatively, the item can just go into the first grid,
		and missing names are treated as ''auto''.

	<p>This property specifies, as a comma-separated list,

		The size can be specified as a length,

	<p>
		The following grammar expresses the allowable values for the 'grid-definition-rows' and 'grid-definition-columns' properties.

	<p>Where:

	<ul>
		<li><dfn id="length">length</dfn> is as defined by CSS3 Values. [[!CSS3VAL]]
		<li><i>percentage</i> expresses a size for a <i>Grid track</i> as a percentage of the <i>Grid element</i>&rsquo;s logical width (for columns) or logical height (for rows).
			When the width or height of the <i>Grid element</i> is dependent on content, the result is undefined.
		<li><dfn id="fraction">fraction</dfn> is a non-negative floating-point number followed
			by 'fr'. Each 'fraction' value takes a share of the remaining space proportional to
			its number.  See <i>fraction values</i> for more details.
		<li><dfn id="max-content">max-content</dfn> is a keyword which refers to the maximum of the max sizes of <i>Grid items</i> occupying

			the <i>Grid track</i>.
		<li><dfn id="minmax">minmax(min, max)</dfn> defines a size range. The size used
			should be greater than or equal to 'min' and less than or equal to 'max'.  If 'max' &lt; 'min',

	<p class="issue">
		Consider whether having undefined behavior for percentage-sized tracks in content-sized grids is appropriate. CSS2.1 and CSS3 leave percentage width undefined, although there appears to be consistency between browser implementations.

	<p class='issue'>
		The current property names imply a grid model more akin to tables than a traditional design grid.
		Consider adjusting terminology to focus on grid lines rather than the spaces between the lines.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			The following example:

		<ul>
			<li>Adds one <i>Grid line</i> 100 pixels from the starting edge of the grid.
			<li>Adds another <i>Grid line</i> 1/2 of the remaining space away.
			<li>Adds another <i>Grid line</i> whose distance from the prior <i>Grid line</i> will be based on the maximum content size of elements
				occupying the column.
			<li>Adds another <i>Grid line</i> whose distance from the prior <i>Grid line</i> is based on
				the minimum content size of all elements occupying the column, or 1/2 the
				remaining space, whichever is greater.

	<p>
		A <i>Grid line</i> exists on either side of a column or row.  The <i>Grid line</i> may be named using one or more quoted strings which are positioned in the 'grid-definition-rows' or 'grid-definition-columns' definitions where the <i>Grid line</i> would logically occur (in between the sizing functions that define the Grid's columns and rows).  Each name associated with a <i>Grid line</i> must be unique for the set of columns or rows.  If the name is specified multiple times in the same column or row definition, it is associated with the first <i>Grid line</i> to which the name was assigned. When a name is not specified, <i>Grid lines</i> can be referred to in the order which they occur.  The first line is 1, the second 2 and so on.  The next example builds on the prior by assigning each line one or more names.

	<pre class="example">&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-definition-columns: "first" "nav" 150px "main" 1fr "last";

<h4 id='repeat-notation'>
Repeating Rows and Columns: the ''repeat()'' notation</h4>

	<p>
		If there are large number of columns or rows that are the same or exhibit a recurring pattern, a repeat function can be applied to define the columns or rows in a more compact form.

	<p>
		The next two examples are equivalent.  There is a single row, and a pattern of repetitive column <i>Grid lines</i>: a 250px column followed by a 10px column.  Note that when the repeat function is used with <i>Grid line</i> naming, that the names are assigned to the first occurrence of the pattern.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-definition-columns: 10px "content" 250px 10px 250px 10px 250px 10px 250px 10px;
		grid-definition-rows: 1fr;
	}

	/* Equivalent definition. */
	#grid {
		display: grid;
		grid-definition-columns: 10px repeat(4, "content" 250px 10px);
		grid-definition-rows: 1fr;
	}
&lt;/style></pre>

<h4 id='fr-unit'>
Flexible Lengths: the ''fr'' unit</h4>

	<p>
		<dfn id="fraction-values">Fraction values</dfn> are new units applicable to the 'grid-definition-rows' and 'grid-definition-columns' properties:

	<dl>
		<dt>fr
		<dd>Fraction of available space.
	</dl>

	<p>
		The distribution of fractional space occurs after all ''length''
		or content-based row and column sizes have reached their maximum.
		The total size of the rows or columns is then subtracted from the available space and the remainder is
		divided proportionately among the fractional rows and columns.

	<p>
		Each column or row's proportional share can be computed as the column or row's
		<code>&lt;fraction> * &lt;remaining space> / &lt;sum of all fractions></code>.
		Note that fractions occurring within a ''minmax'' function are only counted in the sum if in the ''max'' position.
		Further, fractions that occur in the ''min'' position are treated as an absolute length of <code>0px</code>.

	<p>
		When remaining space cannot be determined because the width or height of the <i>Grid element</i> is undefined, fraction-sized <i>Grid tracks</i>
		are sized to their contents while retaining their respective proportions.  In such cases the size of each fractional <i>Grid track</i> can
		be computed by determining the 'max-content' size of each fractional <i>Grid track</i> and dividing that size by the respective
		'fraction'.  The maximum value of those results is treated as the <code>1fr</code> value, which is then multiplied
		by each <i>Grid track</i>&rsquo;s 'fraction' to determine its final size.

<h4>
Resolved Values</h4>

	<p>
		The resolved size of all <i>Grid tracks</i> as returned for the 'grid-definition-rows' and 'grid-definition-columns' properties are normalized to pixel values.
		All <i>Grid tracks</i> are included in the resolved value reported for 'grid-definition-rows' and 'grid-definition-columns' regardless of how the <i>Grid tracks</i> were created, e.g. implicit tracks may be created by <i>Grid items</i> referencing a <i>Grid line</i> not explicitly defined by a 'grid-definition-rows' or 'grid-definition-columns' property.

		The resolved value includes named lines; any duplicate names must be removed. User agents may use the repeat syntax to avoid expansive string length due to implicit <i>Grid track</i> creation,
		large spanning values or high repeat counts specified by the author.

	<p>
		The algorithm used to apply repeat syntax to resolved <i>Grid track</i> values and <i>Grid line</i> names is user agent specific.  See below for example inputs and outputs.

	<pre class="example">
&lt;style type="text/css">
	#grid {
		width: 500px;
		grid-definition-columns:
			"a"         auto
			"b"         minmax(min-content, 1fr)
			"b" "c" "d" repeat(2, "e" 40px)
						repeat(5, auto);
	}
&lt;/style>
&lt;div id="grid">
	&lt;div style="grid-column-position:1; width:50px">&lt;/div>
	&lt;div style="grid-column-position:9; width:50px">&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;script type="text/javascript">
	// Returns '"a" 50px "b" 320px "c" "d" repeat(2, "e" 40px) repeat(4, 0px) 50px'.

	<p>
		<i>Grid areas</i> can also be defined explicitly using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/Overview.html#identifiers">identifiers</a> via the 'grid-template' property. The 'grid-template' property provides a visualization of the <i>Grid element</i>&rsquo;s structure while simultaneously defining the <i>Grid areas</i> which can be used to position and size the child elements of the Grid.

	<p>
		A row is created for every separate string listed for the grid-template property, and a column is created for each identifier or period in each string. Note that all strings must have the same number of columns. A period represents an unnamed area in the <i>grid element</i> that cannot be used to position or size a <i>grid item</i>. An identifier creates a named <i>grid area</i> that can be used to position and size <i>grid items</i>. No two <i>grid areas</i> may have the same identifier. Duplicate identifiers define a <i>grid area</i> which spans multiple tracks, and must therefore be geometrically adjacent to each other, forming a rectangular shape. A declaration which fails to meet these criteria will be dropped.

	<p>
		In the following example, a 'grid-template' property is used to create a page layout where areas are defined for header content <code>head</code>, navigational content <code>nav</code>, footer content <code>foot</code>, and main content <code>main</code>. Accordingly, the template creates three rows, two columns, and four areas.  The <code>head</code> area spans both columns and the first row of the grid. Columns are the tracks that run in the inline direction and rows are the tracks running in the direction of block progression.  See Grid Writing Modes for more details.

	<p>
		The 'grid-area' property, defined in further detail below, is specified on <i>Grid items</i> to position the <i>Grid item</i> inside an explicitly named <i>Grid area</i>.

Note that <i>Grid item</i> <code>B</code> is positioned on <i>Grid line</i> 5 which creates a 5th column to contain <i>Grid item</i> <code>B</code>.

Automatic Grid Item Placement Algorithm</h4>
	<p>
		The following summarizes the algorithm for auto placement of <i>Grid items</i>:

	<ol>
		<li>
			For each <i>Grid item</i> with a major-axis position that is not ''auto'' in source order:
			<ol>
				<li>Resolve the ''auto'' value for its minor-axis position to the minimum value that ensures this item's <i>grid area</i> will not overlap the <i>grid area</i> of any explicitly or previously auto-placed item.
			</ol>

		<li>
			Determine the maximum number of minor tracks based on maximum track number implied by the 'grid-template' property, the 'grid-row-definition' and 'grid-column-position-definition' properties, the position and size of any explicitly-defined <i>grid items</i>, or any minor-axis ''auto'' values resolved by the step 1 of the algorithm. Note that this step must be run prior to the layout algorithm.
		<li>
			Position the <i>auto-placement cursor</i> at position 1,1 in the grid.
		<li>
			For each <i>grid item</i> having an unresolved value of ''auto'', in source order:
			<ol>
				<li>
					If the minor-axis position is not ''auto'', then:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Set the minor-axis position of the cursor to be equal to the minor-axis position of the <i>grid item</i>.
						<li>
							Increment the <i>auto-placement cursor</i> along the major-axis until a value is found where the <i>grid item</i> does not overlap the <i>grid area</i> of any other <i>grid item</i> (creating new major-axis tracks as necessary).
					</ol>

				<li>
					If the minor and major-axis positions are both ''auto'', then:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Increment the minor-axis position of the <i>auto-placement cursor</i> until this item's <i>grid area</i> does not overlap another item's <i>grid area</i>, or causes the <i>grid area</i> to exceed the maximum number of minor-axis tracks previously determined in step 2.
						<li>
							If this item's position is still unresolved after the previous step, then increment the cursor's major-axis position and reset the minor-axis position to 1 (creating new major-axis tracks if necessary).
					</ol>
			</ol>
	</ol>

	<div class='issue'>
		Two mistakes in the algorithm currently:

		<ol>
			<li>Step 2 needs to take into account the major-axis spans of every item as well.  Otherwise, extra-wide single items can create new columns late in auto-placement.

			<li>Step 4 needs to verify that placement also doesn't cause the item to generate new columns.  Currently, it only verifies that placement wont' overlap anything else.
		</ol>
	</div>


	<p class='issue'>
		This algorithm creates a "sparse" packing,
		where holes left behind are never filled in.
		This is more efficient and predictable
		(items never move to a position far above/before their preceding sibling),
		but the gaps are unwanted by authors in some situations.
		We should have a switch to allow for dense packing.
		(WebKit's current implementation does dense packing.)

<h2 id='alignment'>
Alignment</h2>

	<p>
		After a <i>grid container</i>&rsquo;s <i>grid tracks</i> have been sized,
		and the dimensions of all <i>grid items</i> are finalized, 
		<i>grid items</i> can be aligned within their <i>grid areas</i>
		by using ''auto'' margins
		or the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-align/">alignment properties</a>.

	<p>
		By default,
		<i>grid items</i> stretch to fill their <i>grid area</i>.
		However, if 'justify-self' or 'align-self' compute to a value other than ''stretch''
		or margins are ''auto'',
		<i>grid items</i> will auto-size to fit their contents.		

	<p>
		A value of ''stretch'' causes the <i>Grid item</i>&rsquo;s width to shrink or grow in accordance with the equation for calculating width
		described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#blockwidth">section 9.3 of the CSS3 Box Model</a>, with the following exception: the paragraph in 9.3 which describes the behavior of items that are larger than their containing block is not applicable for the purpose of calculating the size of <i>Grid items</i>. Note that this calculation is symmetric for both the width and height
		of the <i>Grid item</i>.

	<p class='issue'>
		The preceding paragraph seems inconsistent with Flexbox.
		In Flexbox, auto margins effectively "turn off" stretch entirely,
		so underflowing items get aligned per the margins
		and overflowing items overflow the line
		(rather than being shrunk to the size of the line).
		In the preceding paragraph,
		it seems that stretched grid items will always grow/shrink to the size of the grid area
		regardless of margins.
		I believe we want the Flexbox behavior.


<h3 id='auto-margins'>
Aligning with ''auto'' margins</h3>

	<p>
		<em>This section is non-normative.  
			The normative definition of how margins affect grid items is in the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a> section.</em>

	<p>
		Auto margins on <i>grid items</i> have an effect very similar to auto margins in block flow:

	<ul>
		<li>
			During calculations of <i>grid track</i> sizes, auto margins are treated as ''0''.

		<li>
			Auto margins absorb positive free space
			prior to alignment via the alignment properties
			(defined in the next sections).

		<li>
			Overflowing elements ignore their auto margins and overflow in the <i>end</i>/<i>after</i> direction.
	</ul>

	<p class='note'>
		Note that, if free space is distributed to auto margins, 
		the alignment properties will have no effect in that dimension
		because the margins will have stolen all the free space
		left over after flexing.

<h3 id='row-align'>
Row-axis Alignment: the 'justify-self' and 'justify-items' properties</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> can be aligned in the inline dimension 
		by using the 'justify-self' property on the <i>grid item</i>
		or 'justify-items' property on the <i>grid container</i>,
		as defined in [[!CSS3-ALIGN]].

	<div class='example'>
		For example,
		for an English document,
		the inline axis is horizontal,
		and so the 'justify-*' properties align the <i>grid items</i> horizontally.

TODO: provide example
		</pre>
	</div>




<h3 id='column-align'>
Column-axis Alignment: the 'align-self' and 'align-items' properties</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> can also be aligned in the block dimension
		(perpendicular to the inline dimension)
		by using the 'align-self' property on the <i>grid item</i>
		or 'align-items' property on the <i>grid container</i>,
		as defined in [[!CSS3-ALIGN]].

	<p>
		<i>Grid items</i> can overlap when they are positioned into intersecting <i>grid areas</i>.
		<i>Grid item</i> boxes in non-intersecting areas can also overlap because of negative margins or positioning.

	<p>
		When <i>grid items</i> overlap, 
		the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#propdef-z-index">'z-index'</a> property provides control over the drawing order of <i>grid items</i>.
		<i>Grid items</i> paint exactly the same as block-level elements in the normal flow, 
		except that 'z-index' values other than ''auto'' create a stacking context even if 'position' is ''static''.

	<p class='note'>
		Note: Descendants that are positioned outside a flex item still participate in any stacking context established by the flex item.

	<p>

			This is the core <i>Grid track</i> sizing algorithm.  It is run for Grid columns and Grid rows.  The goal of the function is to ensure:

		<ol>
			<li>That each <i>Grid track</i> satisfies its MinTrackSizingFunction
			<li>That each <i>Grid track</i> grows from the breadth which satisfied its MinTrackSizingFunction to a breadth which satisfies its MaxTrackSizingFunction, subject to RemainingSpace.
		</ol>
		<p>
			For the purposes of resolving the breadth that satisfies the MinTrackSizingFunction and MaxTrackSizingFunction, each <i>Grid track</i> falls into one of three categories:

		<ol>
			<li>A percentage or length value which can be trivially resolved.
			<li>A min-content or max-content value which will be resolved based on the measurements of the <i>Grid items</i> which cover the <i>Grid track</i>.
			<li>A fraction value which can only be resolved after determining the RemainingSpace in the <i>Grid element</i>&rsquo;s content box after having considered all contributions from the prior two categories of <i>Grid tracks</i>.
		</ol>
		<p>
			The breadths which satisfy MinTrackSizingFunctions and MaxTrackSizingFunctions for the first category of <i>Grid tracks</i> are resolved in step 1 during <i>Grid track</i> variable initialization.
			The breadths which satisfy the MinTrackSizingFunctions and the MaxTrackSizingFunctions for the second category of content-sized <i>Grid tracks</i> are resolved in step 2.  At the end of step 2, the first goal of ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks function has been satisfied:
			the UsedBreadth variable of each GridTrack now satisfies its MinTrackSizingFunction. The MaxBreadth variable for each <i>Grid track</i> now contains the resolved value for its MaxTrackSizingFunction.

		<p>
			In step 3, the second goal of this function is satisfied as each (non-fraction-sized) <i>Grid track</i>
			attempts to grow from the UsedBreadth value to the MaxBreadth value, subject to RemainingSpace.

		<p>
			Finally in step 4, the third category of fraction-sized <i>Grid tracks</i> can be resolved using what is now the RemainingSpace having updated the UsedBreadth of each <i>Grid track</i> at the end of step 3.

			The purpose of this function is to resolve the contribution that each <i>Grid item</i> makes to any min-content or max-content TrackSizingFunctions for the <i>Grid tracks</i> it covers. There are four permutations: min-content or max-content in either the MinTrackSizingFunction or MaxTrackSizingFunction. MinTrackSizingFunctions are resolved before MaxTrackSizingFunctions, and min-content contributions are resolved before max-content contributions. Note that when resolving min-content contributions they may grow tracks that have either min-content or max-content keywords, as seen in 3.a.i and 3.b.i below.

		<p class="issue">
			Currently this algorithm embodies several heuristics which regulate the growth of spanning <i>Grid items</i> to accommodate certain use cases. (E.g. the game example in Figures 2 and 3 above.) These heuristics should be a normative part of this specification to ensure interoperability. To the extent additional use cases can be identified that cannot be satisfied by following the current heuristics, the normative algorithm can be updated, or additional mechanisms can be introduced for fine-grained control of content-based TrackSizingFunction.

			Ensures that for each <i>Grid track</i> in RecipientTracks, a value will be computed, UpdatedTrackBreadth, that represents the <i>Grid track</i>&rsquo;s share of SpaceToDistribute.

		<p>
			There are two parts to this function.  The first for loop in step 2 is giving each <i>Grid track</i> an equal share of the space, but without exceeding their TrackGrowthConstraint values.
			Because there are different MaxBreadths assigned to the different <i>Grid tracks</i>, the first loop can result in their uneven growth.

		<p>
			If the first loop completes having grown every <i>Grid track</i> to its TrackGrowthConstraint, and there is still SpaceToDistribute, then  SubsetOfTracksForGrowthBeyondTrackGrowthConstraint are further grown equally until SpaceToDistribute is exhausted.

		<p>
			Note that <i>Grid tracks</i> considered by this function may have a TrackGrowthConstraint equal to Infinity, which signals that these tracks have not yet been grown by a <i>Grid item</i>. These tracks can therefore be grown without exceeding the TrackGrowthConstraint of the track. By only growing tracks up to their TrackGrowthConstraint value, we can ensure that the grid remains "tight" - that is, that track breadth is as close to the content size of the <i>Grid items</i> inside as possible. Only once all <i>Grid tracks</i> have a CurrentBreadth equal to a TrackGrowthConstraint do we move to the second for loop and grow tracks further, thereby making the <i>Grid element</i> less tight.

Defining the Shrink-to-fit Behavior of Grid Elements</h3>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#shrink-to-fit">CSS3 Box Model</a> defines the shrink-to-fit behavior of an element as min(max(preferred minimum width, available width), preferred width), with available width defined in the Box Model spec. Accordingly, for the <i>Grid element</i> we define the preferred minimum width as the sum of the UsedBreadths of the <i>Grid tracks</i> just before step 3 in ComputeUsedBreadthOfGridTracks, and the preferred width as the sum of the UsedBreadths of the <i>Grid tracks</i> after the entire track sizing algorithm has been run with infinite space.

Module interactions</h3>

	<p>
		This module extends the definition of the 'display' property [[!CSS21]],
		adding a new block-level and new inline-level display type,
		and defining a new type of formatting context
		along with properties to control its layout.
		None of the properties defined in this module apply to the ''::first-line'' or ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>
		This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]].
		Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
		Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types:
		for example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module,
		expands the definition of the <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> value type as used in this specification.

	<p>
		In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
		all properties defined in this specification also accept the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">''inherit''</a> keyword as their property value.
		For readability it has not been repeated explicitly.

<h3 id="conventions">
Document conventions</h3>

	<p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
	descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
	“MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
	“RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
	document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
	However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
	letters in this specification.

	<p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
	explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

	<p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
	or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
	like this:

	<div class="example">
		<p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
	normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

	<p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

	<p>Conformance to CSS Grid Layout Module
	is defined for three conformance classes:
	<dl>
		<dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
			style sheet</a>.
		<dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
			documents that use them.
		<dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
			that writes a style sheet.
	</dl>

	<p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Grid Layout Module
	if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
	according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
	feature defined in this module.

	<p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Grid Layout Module
	if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
	appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
	by CSS Grid Layout Module by parsing them correctly
	and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
	UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
	does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
	required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)

	<p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Grid Layout Module
	if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
	generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
	this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
	as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

	<p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
	assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
	treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
	as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
	and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
	support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
	ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
	multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
	(as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
	be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

	<p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
	reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
	syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.

	<p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
	in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
	experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
	use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
	W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
	in the draft.
	</p>

<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

	<p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
	non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
	release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
	can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.

	<p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
	implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
	CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
	testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
	releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
	submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
	Working Group.

	<p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
	can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
	Questions should be directed to the
	<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
	mailing list.
