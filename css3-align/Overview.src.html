<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

  <p>This module contains the features of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS</a> relating to
  the alignment of boxes within their containers
  in the various CSS box layout models:
  block layout, table layout, flexbox layout, and grid layout.
  (The alignment of text and inline-level content is defined in [[CSS3TEXT]]
  and [[CSS3LINEBOX]].)
  CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents
  (such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc.

Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

  <p>CSS Levels 1 and 2 allowed for the alignment of text via 'text-align' and
  the alignment of blocks by balancing ''auto'' margins. However, except in
  table cells, vertical alignment was not possible. As CSS3 adds further
  capabilities, the ability to align boxes in various dimensions becomes more
  critical. This module attempts to create a cohesive and common box alignment
  model to share among all of CSS.
  
  <p class=note>The alignment of text and inline-level content is defined in [[CSS3TEXT]]
  and [[CSS3LINEBOX]].

  <p>Inspiration for this document:

<h3 id="placement">
Module interactions</h3>

  <p>This module adds some new alignment capabilities to the block layout
  model described in [[!CSS21]] chapters 9 and 10 and defines the interaction
  of these properties with the alignment of table cell content using
  'vertical-align', as defined in [[!CSS21]] chapter 17.
  The interaction of these properties with
  Grid Layout [[!CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]
  and Flexbox Layout [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]]
  is defined in their respective modules.

  <p>No properties in this module apply to the <code>::first-line</code> or
  <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3VALUES]], when combined with this module, adds the
  ''initial'' keyword as a possible property value.
  
  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.
  
<h2 id="overview">
Overview of Alignment Properties</h2>

  <p>The alignment properties in CSS can be described along two axes:
  which dimension they apply to,
  and whether they control the position of the box within its parent,
  or the box's content within itself.

  <p class=issue>True alignment vs. safe alignment. Maybe make safe by default, true if ''true'' is specified?
  (Using that in the spec for now.) Or safe/true depending on layout model (e.g. safe for blocks, true for flexbox).

  <p>The following table summarizes the proposed alignment properties
  and their relation to the alignment properties existing in other modules.

  <p>Justifies the box within its parent along the inline/row axis:
  the box's outer edges are aligned within its containing block as described below.
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>For block-level elements, use alignment specified by the 'content-justify'
      property of the containing block.
      For grid items, indicates that the element should stretch to fill its slot.
    <dt><dfn>''start''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Start-aligns the box within its containing block.
    <dt><dfn>''center''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Centers the box within its containing block.
    <dt><dfn>''end''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>End-aligns the box within its containing block.
    <dt><dfn>''true''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>If specified, alignment is "true", and may cause the box to overflow
      the start edge of the containing block.
      Otherwise, the box is forced to start-align
      when its outer measure is wider than the containing block.
  </dl>

  <p>In terms of CSS2.1 block-level formatting,
  the rules for "over-constrained" computations in section 10.3.3 are used
  only when the element's margin box overflows the containing block
  <em>and</em> the ''true'' keyword is not specified.
  Otherwise those rules are ignored in favor of alignment as specified above,
  and the used value of the end margin is not adjusted to correct for the over-constraint.

  <div class="example">
    <p>The effect of these rules is that an auto-sized block-level table,
    for example, can be aligned while still having side margins.
    If the table's max-content size is narrower than its containing block,
    then it is shrink-wrapped to that size and aligned as specified.
    If the table's max-content size is wider, then it fills its containing block,
    and the margins provide appropriate spacing from the containing block edges.
  </div>

  <p>For block-level elements that establish a block formatting context
  and are placed next to a float, alignment is with respect to the
  available space (subtracting out from the containing block measure the space taken up by the float),
  not with respect to the containing block.
  (Note: This is the legacy behavior of HTML <code>align</code>.)

  <p class=note>This property would replace 'grid-column-align'.

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>For flexbox items, computes to alignment specified by the 'child-align'
      property of the flexbox container.
      For grid items, computes to ''stretch''.
    <dt><dfn>''baseline''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Shifts the box such that the baseline of its <i>first formatted line</i>

  <p>For flex items "before" and "after" are interpreted relative to the

  <p>Gives the default alignment of the box's content along the inline/row axis.
  For block containers, this simply changes the meaning of ''box-justify: auto'' on its children.
  For flexbox containers, this aligns the contents of each flexbox line within its flexbox line box.
  See [[!CSS3FLEXBOX]] for exact details.

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>If the element has ''display: block'' and ''box-justify: auto'',
      computes to the value inherited from the parent.
      Otherwise computes to ''start''.
    <dt><dfn>''start''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Start-aligns the content within its box.
    <dt><dfn>''end''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>End-aligns the content within its box.
    <dt><dfn>''left''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Aligns content to the line-left edge.
      On a flexbox container, this is treated as ''auto'' if the line-left direction is in the wrong dimension.
    <dt><dfn>''right''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Aligns content to the line-right edge.
      On a flexbox container, this is treated as ''auto'' if the line-right direction is in the wrong dimension.
    <dt><dfn>''center''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Centers the content within its box
    <dt><dfn>''distribute''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Distributes the content evenly throughout the line by adjusting inter-child spacing.
      If there is only one child (or if the element is a block container), this is equivalent to centering.
    <dt><dfn>''space''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Distributes the content evenly throughout the line by adjusting inter-child spacing
      and applying half of that spacing between the first/last child and the box edges.
      If there is only one child (or if the element is a block container), this is equivalent to centering.
    <dt><dfn>''true''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>If specified, alignment is "true", and may cause the contents to overflow
      the start edge of the box.
      Otherwise, the content is forced to start-align
      if its total outer measure (before ''distribute'' or ''space'' is applied)
      is wider than the containing block.
  </dl>

  <p class=note>This property would replace 'flex-pack'
  and would, in conjunction with 'text-align', implement the HTML <code>align</code> attribute and <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>.
  The weird behavior of ''auto'' is for that and because ''display: block'' elements are essentially transparent, layout-wise,
  so passing through the alignment unchanged is useful and probably intuitive to authors (though it's really weird for implementers).</span>

  <p>Aligns the box's content within the box along the block/column/cross axis.
  Values have the following meanings:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>For block containers, equivalent to ''before'',
      except that it does not cause the block to establish a block formatting context.
      For table cells, defers alignment to 'vertical-align' as specified in [[!CSS21]] chapter 17.
      For flexbox containers, it causes any positive free space to be distributed equally across the lines. [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]]
    <dt><dfn>''before''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Before-aligns the box's content within its content box:
      the content is laid out beginning at the box's before content edge.
    <dt><dfn>''center''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Centers the box's content within its content box:
      the content is centered between the box's before and after content edges.
    <dt><dfn>''after''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>After-aligns the box's content within its content box:
      the content is laid out so that it finishes at the after content edge.
    <dt><dfn>''baseline''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>For table cells, grid items, and flexbox items, aligns this elements's
      <i>first formatted line</i>&apos;s baseline, if any,
      with the same baseline in other ''baseline''-aligned cells/items in the same row.
      This is equivalent to the behavior of ''vertical-align: baseline'' on table cells;
      see [[!CSS21]] chapter 17 for details.
      If size constraints prevent the baselines from fully aligning,
      alignment is as close as possible.
      If the content's position is not fully determined by baseline alignment,
      the content is before-aligned insofar as possible while preserving the baseline alignment.
      (Content that has no first-line baseline is thus also before-aligned.)
    <dt><dfn>''distribute''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>For flexbox containers, distributes lines evenly by adjusting inter-line spacing.
      If there is only one line (or if the element is container of line boxes), this is equivalent to centering.
      UAs may also apply ''distribute'' to lines in a block container.
    <dt><dfn>''space''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>For flexbox containers, distributes lines evenly by adjusting inter-line spacing
      and applying half of that spacing between the first/last child and the box edges.
      If there is only one line (or if the element is not a container of line boxes), this is equivalent to centering.
      UAs may also apply ''distribute'' to lines in a block container.
    <dt><dfn>''true''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>If specified, alignment is "true", and may cause the content to overflow
      the before edge of the containing block.
      Otherwise, the content is forced to before-align
      if is longer than the box's content area,
      and will thus overflow only the after edge.

  <p>All values other than ''auto'' cause a block box to establish a block formatting context
  such that its margins do not collapse with its children and floats do not intrude into its content box.

  <p>For flexbox containers "before" and "after" are interpreted relative to the
  flex flow, not the writing mode. <span class=issue>Is this actually what we want?
  Even in the overflow-correction case?</span>

  <p class=note>This would replace 'flex-line-pack'.


<h2 id="default-alignment">
  Default Alignment of Child Items</h2>

  <p>The 'items-align' and 'items-justify' properties, when set on a
  flexbox or grid container, set the default 'box-align' and 'box-justify'
  behavior of the items contained by the element.

  <div class=figure>
    <p><img src=child-target.jpg>
  </div>

<h3 id="child-justify">
  Inline/Main-Axis Alignment: the 'items-justify' property</h3>

  <p class=issue>This could be applied to grid elements and set
  the default alignment of the grid items. It mainly exists because Flexbox
  requires 'items-align' (i.e. 'flex-align'); see below.

  <table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>items-justify</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:

  <p>Sets the default 'box-align' of the flexbox container's children or the
  grid container's items.
  The ''auto'' value computes to ''stretch'' on flexbox and grid containers.
  
  <p class=note>This property replaces 'flex-align', which sets the default 'flex-item-align' of its children.

  “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
  “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this

  like this:
  
  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>

  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Box Alignment Module Level 3
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>
  
  <p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Box Alignment Module Level 3
  if all of its statements that use syntax defined in this module are valid
  according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
  feature defined in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Box Alignment Module Level 3
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by CSS Box Alignment Module Level 3 by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Box Alignment Module Level 3
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>
  
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
  
  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>
 
<h3 id="testing">
Non-experimental implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
  
  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.
  
  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR exit criteria</h3>

  <p class=issue>[Change or remove the following CR exit criteria if
  the spec is not a module, but, e.g., a Note or a profile. This text was <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/44"> decided on 2008-06-04.</a>]</p>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>
  
  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.
