Abstract: This CSS module defines pseudo-elements, abstract elements that represent portions of the CSS render tree that can be selected and styled.
Ignored Terms: typographic letter unit, Unicode general category
</pre>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is informative.</em>

  <i>Pseudo-elements</i> represent abstract elements of the document
  beyond those elements explicitly created by the document language.
  Since they are not restricted to fitting into the document tree,
  the can be used the select and style portions of the document
  that do not necessarily map to the document's tree structure.
  For instance, the ''::first-line'' pseudo-element can
  select content on the first formatted line of an element
  <em>after</em> text wrapping,
  allowing just that line to be styled differently
  from the rest of the paragraph.

  Each pseudo-element is associated with an <i>originating element</i>
  and has syntax of the form ''::name-of-pseudo''.
  This module defines the pseudo-elements that exist in CSS
  and how they can be styled.
  For more information on pseudo-elements in general,
  and on their syntax and interaction with other <i>selectors</i>,
  see [[!SELECTORS4]].

<h3 id="first-line-pseudo">
The ::first-line pseudo-element</h3>

  The <dfn>::first-line</dfn> pseudo-element describes the contents of
  the <i>first formatted line</i> of an element. 

  <div class="example">
    The rule below means
    “change the letters of the first line of every <code>p</code> element to uppercase”:
  
    <pre>p::first-line { text-transform: uppercase }</pre>

    The selector ''p::first-line''
    does not match any real document element.
    It does match a pseudo-element that conforming user agents
    will insert at the beginning of every <code>p</code> element.
  </div>

  Note: Note that the length of the first line depends on a number of factors,
  including the width of the page, the font size, etc.

  <div class="example">
    For example, given an ordinary HTML [[HTML5]] paragraph such as: 
  
    <pre>
      &lt;P&gt;This is a somewhat long HTML
      paragraph that will be broken into several
      lines. The first line will be identified
      by a fictional tag sequence. The other lines
      will be treated as ordinary lines in the
      paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>
  
    The lines might be broken as follows: 
  
    <pre>
      THIS IS A SOMEWHAT LONG HTML PARAGRAPH THAT
      will be broken into several lines. The first
      line will be identified by a fictional tag
      sequence. The other lines will be treated as
      ordinary lines in the paragraph.
    </pre>

    This paragraph might be “rewritten” by user agents
    to include a <dfn>fictional tag sequence</dfn> to represent ''::first-line''.
    This <i>fictional tag sequence</i> helps to show how properties are inherited. 
    
    <pre>
      &lt;P&gt;<b>&lt;P::first-line&gt;</b> This is a somewhat long HTML
      paragraph that <b>&lt;/P::first-line&gt;</b> will be broken into several
      lines. The first line will be identified
      by a fictional tag sequence. The other lines
      will be treated as ordinary lines in the
      paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  If a pseudo-element breaks up a real element,
  the desired effect can often be described by a <i>fictional tag sequence</i>
  that closes and then re-opens the element.

  <div class="example">
    Thus, if we mark up the previous paragraph with a <code>span</code>
    element encompassing the first sentence: 

    <pre>
      &lt;P&gt;<b>&lt;SPAN class="test"&gt;</b> This is a somewhat long HTML
      paragraph that will be broken into several
      lines.<b>&lt;/SPAN&gt;</b> The first line will be identified
      by a fictional tag sequence. The other lines
      will be treated as ordinary lines in the
      paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>

    the user agent could simulate start and end tags for <code>span</code>
    when inserting the <i>fictional tag sequence</i> for ''::first-line''
    to get the correct inheritance behavior.
  
    <pre>
      &lt;P&gt;&lt;P::first-line&gt;<b>&lt;SPAN class="test"&gt;</b> This is a somewhat long HTML
      paragraph that will <b>&lt;/SPAN&gt;</b>&lt;/P::first-line&gt;<b>&lt;SPAN class="test"&gt;</b> be broken into several
      lines.<b>&lt;/SPAN&gt;</b> The first line will be identified
      by a fictional tag sequence. The other lines
      will be treated as ordinary lines in the
      paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

<h4 id="first-text-line">
The first formatted line</h4>

  In CSS, the ''::first-line'' pseudo-element
  can only have an effect when attached to a <i>block container</i>.
  The <dfn>first formatted line</dfn> of an element
  must occur inside a block-level descendant in the same flow
  (i.e., a block-level descendant that is not out-of-flow due to floating or positioning).

  <div class="example">
    For example, the first line of the <code>DIV</code> in <code>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;This line...&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</code>
    is the first line of the <code>P</code>
    (assuming that both <code>P</code> and <code>DIV</code> are blocks).
  </div>

  The first line of a table-cell or inline-block
  cannot be the first formatted line of an ancestor element.
  Thus, in <code>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P STYLE="display: inline-block"&gt;Hello&lt;BR&gt;Goodbye&lt;/P&gt; etcetera&lt;/DIV&gt;</code>
  the first formatted line of the <code>DIV</code> is not the line "Hello".

  Note: Note that the first line of the <code>p</code> in this fragment:
  <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;First...</code>
  doesn't contain any letters (assuming the default style for <code>br</code>).
  The word "First" is not on the first formatted line. 

  A user agent must act as if the fictional start tags of a ''::first-line'' pseudo-element
  were nested just inside the innermost enclosing block-level element.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the <i>fictional tag sequence</i> for 
    <pre>
      &lt;DIV&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;First paragraph&lt;/P&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/P&gt;
      &lt;/DIV&gt;
    </pre>
    is 
    <pre>
      &lt;DIV&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;&lt;DIV::first-line&gt;&lt;P::first-line&gt;First paragraph&lt;/P::first-line&gt;&lt;/DIV::first-line&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;&lt;P::first-line&gt;Second paragraph&lt;/P::first-line&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
      &lt;/DIV&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  The ''::first-line'' pseudo-element’s generated box
  behaves similar to that of an inline-level element, but with certain restrictions.
  The following CSS properties apply to a ''::first-line'' pseudo-element:
  <ul>
    <li>all font properties (see [[CSS3-FONTS]])
    <li>the 'color' and 'opacity' properties (see [[CSS3COLOR]])
    <li>all background properties (see [[CSS3BG]])
    <li>any typesetting properties that apply to inline elements (see [[CSS3TEXT]])
    <li>all text decoration properties (see [[CSS3-TEXT-DECOR]])
    <li>any inline layout properties that apply to inline elements (see [[CSS3LINE]])
    <li>any other properties defined to apply to ''::first-letter''
        by their respective specifications
  </ul>
  User agents may apply other properties as well.

  During CSS inheritance, the portion of a child element that occurs on the first line
  only inherits properties applicable to the ''::first-line'' pseudo-element
  from the ''::first-line'' pseudo-element.
  For all other properties inheritence is
  from the non-pseudo-element parent of the first line pseudo element.
  (The portion of a child element that does not occur on the first line
  always inherits from the parent of that child.) 

<h3 id="first-letter-pseudo">
The ::first-letter pseudo-element</h3>

  The <dfn>::first-letter</dfn> pseudo-element represents
  the first <i>typographic letter unit</i> of an element,
  if it is not preceded by any other content
  (such as images or inline tables) on its line.
  The ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element can be used
  to create “initial caps” and “drop caps”,
  which are common typographical effects. 
  Punctuation (i.e, characters that belong to the Punctuation (<code>P</code>) <i>Unicode general category</i> [[!UAX44]])
  that precedes or follows the first <i>typographic letter unit</i> must also be included
  in the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element.

  <div class="figure">
      <img alt="Quotes that precede the first letter should be included." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/first-letter2.png">
  </div>

  The ''::first-letter'' also applies if the first letter is in
  fact a digit, e.g., the “6” in “67 million dollars is a lot of money.”
 
  Note: In some cases the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element
  should include more than just the first non-punctuation character on a line.
  For example, combining characters must be kept with their base character.
  Additionally, some languages may have specific rules about
  how to treat certain letter combinations.
  The User-Agent definition of ''::first-letter''
  should include at least the default grapheme cluster as defined by UAX29
  and may include more than that as appropriate.
  In Dutch, for example, if the letter combination "ij" appears at the beginning of an element,
  both letters should be considered within the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element. [[UAX29]]

  If the letters that would form the ''::first-letter''
  are not in the same element,
  such as "‘T" in <code>&lt;p&gt;'&lt;em&gt;T...</code>,
  the user agent may create a ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element
  from one of the elements, both elements,
  or simply not create a pseudo-element.
  Similarly, if the first letter(s) of the block
  are not at the start of the line (for example due to bidirectional reordering),
  then the user agent need not create the pseudo-element(s). 

  <div class="example" id="overlapping-example">
    The following CSS and HTML example
    illustrates how overlapping pseudo-elements may interact.
    The first letter of each P element will be green with a font size of ’24pt'.
    The rest of the first formatted line will be blue
    while the rest of the paragraph will be red.

    <pre>
      p { color: red; font-size: 12pt }
      p::first-letter { color: green; font-size: 200% }
      p::first-line { color: blue }
      
      &lt;P&gt;Some text that ends up on two lines&lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>

    Assuming that a line break will occur before the word "ends",
    the <i>fictional tag sequence</i> for this fragment might be:
    <pre>
      &lt;P&gt;
      &lt;P::first-line&gt;
      &lt;P::first-letter&gt;
      S
      &lt;/P::first-letter&gt;ome text that
      &lt;/P::first-line&gt;
      ends up on two lines
      &lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>

    Note that the ''::first-letter'' element is inside the ''::first-line'' element.
    Properties set on ''::first-line'' are inherited by ''::first-letter'',
    but are overridden if the same property is set on ''::first-letter''.
  </div>

  The first letter must occur on the <i>first formatted line</i>.
  For example, in this HTML fragment: <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;First...</code>
  the first line doesn't contain any letters
  and ''::first-letter'' doesn't match anything
  (assuming the default style for <code>br</code> in HTML 4).
  In particular, it does not match the “F” of “First”.

<h4 id="application-in-css">
Application in CSS</h4>

  In CSS, the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element
  only applies to block containers.
  <span class="note">A future version of this specification
  may allow this pseudo-element to apply to more display types.</span>
  The ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element can be used
  with all such elements that contain text,
  or that have a descendant in the same flow that contains text.
  A user agent should act as if the fictional start tag
  of the ::first-letter pseudo-element
  is just before the first text of the element,
  even if that first text is in a descendant.

  <div class="example">
    Example:
    The <i>fictional tag sequence</i> for this HTML fragment: 
    <pre>
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first text.
    </pre>
    is:
    <pre>
      &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;div::first-letter&gt;&lt;p::first-letter&gt;T&lt;/...&gt;&lt;/...&gt;he first text.
    </pre>
  </div>

  In CSS the first letter of a table-cell or inline-block
  cannot be the first letter of an ancestor element.
  Thus, in <code>&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P STYLE="display: inline-block"&gt;Hello&lt;BR&gt;Goodbye&lt;/P&gt; etcetera&lt;/DIV&gt;</code>
  the first letter of the <code>DIV</code> is not the letter "H".
  In fact, the <code>DIV</code> doesn't have a first letter. 
  If an element is a list item (''display: list-item''),
  the ''::first-letter'' applies
  to the first letter in the principal box <em>after</em> the marker.
  User-Agents may ignore ''::first-letter''
  on list items with ''list-style-position: inside''.
  If an element has ''::before'' or ''::after'' content,
  the ''::first-letter'' applies to the first letter of the
  element <em>including</em> that content.

  <div class="example">
    Example:
    After the rule ''p::before {content: "Note: "}'', the
    selector ''p::first-letter'' matches the "N" of "Note".
  </div>

  In CSS a ::first-letter pseudo-element is similar to an inline-level element
  if its 'float' property is ''none'';
  otherwise, it is similar to a floated element.
  The following properties that apply to ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements:
  <ul>
    <li>all font properties (see [[CSS3-FONTS]])
    <li>the 'color' and 'opacity' properties (see [[CSS3COLOR]])
    <li>all background properties (see [[CSS3BG]])
    <li>any typesetting properties that apply to inline elements (see [[CSS3TEXT]])
    <li>all text decoration properties (see [[CSS3-TEXT-DECOR]])
    <li>any inline layout properties that apply to inline elements (see [[CSS3LINE]])
    <li>margin and padding properties (see [[CSS21]])
    <li>border properties and 'box-shadow' (see [[CSS3BG]])
    <li>any other properties defined to apply to ''::first-letter''
        by their respective specifications
  </ul>
  User agents may apply other properties as well.

  To allow User-Agents to render a typographically correct drop cap or initial cap,
  the User-Agent may choose a line-height, width and height
  based on the shape of the letter, unlike for normal elements.
  
  <div class="example">
    Example:
    This CSS and HTML example shows a possible rendering of an initial cap.
    Note that the 'line-height' that is inherited
    by the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element is 1.1,
    but the User-Agent in this example has computed the height
    of the first letter box differently,
    so that it doesn't cause any unnecessary space between the first two lines.
    Also note that the fictional start tag of the first letter
    is inside the <span>span</span>,
    and thus the font weight of the first letter is normal,
    not bold as the <span>span</span>:
  
    <pre>
      p { line-height: 1.1 }
      p::first-letter { font-size: 3em; font-weight: normal }
      span { font-weight: bold }
      ...
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Het hemelsche&lt;/span&gt; gerecht heeft zich ten lange lesten&lt;br&gt;
      Erbarremt over my en mijn benaeuwde vesten&lt;br&gt;
      En arme burgery, en op mijn volcx gebed&lt;br&gt;
      En dagelix geschrey de bange stad ontzet.
    </pre>
    
    <div class="figure">
        <img alt="Image illustrating the ::first-letter pseudo-element" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/initial-cap.png">
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    The following CSS will make a drop cap initial letter span about two lines:
    <pre>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"&gt;
      &lt;HTML&gt;
       &lt;HEAD&gt;
        &lt;TITLE&gt;Drop cap initial letter&lt;/TITLE&gt;
        &lt;STYLE type="text/css"&gt;
         P               { font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.2 }
         P::first-letter { font-size: 200%; font-weight: bold; float: left }
         SPAN            { text-transform: uppercase }
        &lt;/STYLE&gt;
       &lt;/HEAD&gt;
       &lt;BODY&gt;
        &lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;The first&lt;/SPAN&gt; few words of an article
          in The Economist.&lt;/P&gt;
       &lt;/BODY&gt;
      &lt;/HTML&gt;
    </pre>

    This example might be formatted as follows:

    <div class="figure">
        <img alt="Image illustrating the combined effect of the ::first-letter
   and ::first-line pseudo-elements" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/first-letter.png">
    </div>

    The <i>fictional tag sequence</i> is:

    <pre>
      &lt;P&gt;
        &lt;SPAN&gt;
          &lt;P::first-letter&gt;
            T
          &lt;/P::first-letter&gt;he first
        &lt;/SPAN&gt;
        few words of an article in the Economist.
      &lt;/P&gt;
    </pre>

    Note that the ''::first-letter'' pseudo-element tags abut the
    content (i.e., the initial character), while the ::first-line
    pseudo-element start tag is inserted right after the start tag of the
    block element.
  </div>

  In order to achieve traditional drop caps formatting, user agents may
  approximate font sizes, for example to align baselines. Also, the glyph
  outline may be taken into account when formatting. 

<h3 id="generated-content">
The ::before and ::after pseudo-elements</h3>

  The <dfn>::before</dfn> and <dfn>::after</dfn> pseudo-elements
  can be used to describe generated content before or after
  an element's content.
  They are explained in CSS 2.1 [[!CSS21]].

  When the ''::first-letter'' and ''::first-line'' pseudo-elements
  are applied to an element having content generated
  using ''::before'' or ''::after'' pseudo-elements,
  they apply to the first letter or line of the element including the generated content. 

  A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#rule-sets">CSS rule</a>
  using ''::before'' or ''::after'' creates a pseudo-element only if
  the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#computed-value">computed
    values</a> of the '<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#content">content</a>'
  property and the '<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/#the-flow-from-property"><span
      class="property">flow-from</span></a>'
  property [[CSS3-REGIONS]] are not both ''none''.

<h2 id="cssom">
Additions to the CSS Object Model</h2>

  Pseudo-elements should be reachable by script,
  stylable from script,
  and available as event targets.
  
  <p class="note"><span class="note-prefix">Note </span>We may extend this
    section in the future to allow creation of pseudo-elements from script.

<h3 id="CSSPseudoElement-interface">
Interface CSSPseudoElement</h3>

  The <code>CSSPseudoElement</code> interface
  allows pseudo-elements to be styleable from script
  and makes them event targets.

  <div class="issue">
    The approach in this draft
    is to start with a bare minimum
    for the CSSPseudoElement interface
    and build up from there.
    Another more radical approach
    could take everything that's common
    between a pseudo-element and a node
    and create a new base class
    for both Node and CSSPseudoElement.
  </div>

  <pre class="idl">
    interface CSSPseudoElement {
        readonly attribute unsigned long <a href="#dom-csspseudochild-ordinal">ordinal</a>;
                                         // the ordinal of a column is its index
        readonly attribute DOMString <a href="#dom-csspseudochild-type">type</a>;

    };

    CSSPseudoElement implements EventTarget;
  </pre>

  The <dfn id="dom-csspseudochild-ordinal">ordinal</dfn> attribute
  represents the ordinal of the pseudo-element for the object's type.
  It is a strictly positive integer.
  The value <code>1</code> for the <code>before</code>&nbsp;
  (or <code>after</code>, <code>letter</code> and <code>line</code>)
  types represents the ''::before'' (or ''::after'',
  ''::first-letter'' and ''::first-line'')
  pseudo-elements.
  The <dfn id="dom-csspseudochild-type">type</dfn> attribute
  is a string representing the type of the pseudo-element.
  This can be one of the following values:

  <dl>
    <dt>‘before’
    <dd>The pseudo-element was created before the element's contents
    <dt>‘after’
    <dd>The pseudo-element was created after the element's contents
    <dt>‘letter’
    <dd>The pseudo-element is the first letter of the element;
    the only valid ordinal is 1.
    <dt>‘line’
    <dd>The pseudo-element is the first line of the element;
    the only valid ordinal is 1.
    <dt>‘column’
    <dd>The pseudo-element is a column created by the element through
    the CSS Multi-column Layout Module.
    In that case its <code>ordinal</code> is
    the index of column in the collection of columns created by the element.
  </dl>

  The <dfn id="dom-csspseudochild-style">style</dfn> attribute
  is a <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code> [[!CSSOM]]
  that allows directly setting style information (inline styles) onto the pseudo-element.
  Inline styles on a <code>CSSPseudoElement</code> have precedence over all
  style rules styling that pseudo-element.
  Issue: This should cascade like actual inline styles, not be a different thing.
  
  The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-EventTarget"><code>EventTarget</code></a> interface [[!DOM-LEVEL-2-EVENTS]]
  must be implemented by all instances of <code>CSSPseudoElement</code>
  as a conformance requirement of this module.

<h3 id="CSSPseudoElementList-interface">
Interface CSSPseudoElementList</h3>

  The <code>CSSPseudoElementList</code> represents an ordered collection
  of <code>CSSPseudoElement</code> instances.

  <pre class="idl">
    interface CSSPseudoElementList {
        readonly attribute unsigned long <a href="#dom-csspseudochildlist-length">length</a>;

                         // replies null if no pseudo-element does not exist for
                         //     the requested ordinal and type
    };
  </pre>

  The <dfn id="dom-csspseudochildlist-length">length</dfn> attribute
  represents the number of <code>CSSPseudoElement</code> in the
  collection or zero if it is empty.
  The method <dfn id="dom-csspseudochildlist-item">item()</dfn>
  is used to retrieve a <code>CSSPseudo</code><code>Element</code> by index.
  It takes one parameter being the requested index into the collection.
  Its return value is the <code>CSSPseudo</code><code>Element</code>
  at the requested index in the collection
  or null if that is not a valid index.
  The method <dfn id="dom-csspseudochildlist-getbyordinalandtype">getByOrdinalAndType()</dfn>
  is used to retrieve a <code>CSSPseudo</code><code>Element</code>
  by its ordinal and type.
  It takes two parameters: first, the requested ordinal; second a type.
  Its return value is the <code>CSSPseudo</code><code>Element</code>
  at the requested index in the collection
  or null if there is no <code>CSSPseudo</code><code>Element</code>
  in the collection for that index and type.

<h3 id="window-interface">
Addition to the <code>window</code> interface</h3>

  A new method is added to the <code>Window</code> interface to retrieve
  pseudo-elements created by a given element for a given type:
  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface Window {
      CSSPseudoElementList <a href="#dom-window-getpseudochildren">getPseudoElements</a>(Element elt,
                                           DOMString type);
    };
  </pre>

  The <dfn id="dom-window-getpseudochildren"><code>getPseudoElements()</code></dfn> method
  is used to retrieve all <code>CSSPseudoElement</code> instances
  created by the element <code>elt</code> for the type <code>type</code>.
  Its return value is a <code>CSSPseudoElementList</code>,
  potentially empty if no pseudo-element exists for the given element and the given type.
