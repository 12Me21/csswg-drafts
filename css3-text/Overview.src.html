<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

  <p>[document here]</p>

  <p class="issue">This draft describes features that are specific to certain scripts.
  There is an ongoing discussion about where these features belong: in
  existing CSS properties, in new CSS properties, or perhaps in other
  specifications.


<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>This module replaces and extends the text-level
  features defined in [[!CSS21]] chapter 16.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the
  definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>

  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.

<h3 id="terms">
Terminology</h3>

  <p id="grapheme-cluster">A <dfn>grapheme cluster</dfn> is what
    a language user considers to be a character or a basic unit of the
    script. The term is described in detail in the Unicode Technical
    Report: Text Boundaries [[!UAX29]]. This specification uses the
    <em>extended grapheme cluster</em> definition in [[!UAX29]] (not
    the <em>legacy grapheme cluster</em> definition). The UA may further
    tailor the definition as allowed by Unicode. Within this specification,
    the ambiguous term <dfn>character</dfn> is used as a friendlier synonym
    for <i>grapheme cluster</i>.
    See <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#character-properties">Characters and Properties</a>
    for how to determine the Unicode properties of a character.

  <p id="letter">A <dfn>letter</dfn> for the purpose of this specification
    is a <i>character</i> belonging to one of the Letter or Number general
    categories in Unicode. [[!UAX44]]

  <p>The rendering characteristics of a <i>character</i> divided by an
    element boundary is undefined: it may be rendered as belonging to
    either side of the boundary, or as some approximation of belonging
    to both. Authors are forewarned that dividing grapheme clusters by
    element boundaries may give inconsistent or undesired results.

  <p>The <dfn>content language</dfn> of an element is the (human) language
    the element is declared to be in, according to the rules of the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#doclanguage">document language</a>.
    For example, the rules for determining the <i>content language</i> of an HTML
    element use the <code>lang</code> attribute and are defined in [[HTML5]],
    and the rules for determining the <i>content language</i> of an XML element use
    the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute and are
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-lang-tag">defined</a> in [[XML10]].
    Note that it is possible for the <i>content language</i> of an element
    to be unknown.

  <p>Other terminology and concepts used in this specification are defined
    in [[!CSS21]] and [[!CSS3-WRITING-MODES]].

<h2 id="transforming">
  Transforming Text</h2>

  <h3 id="text-transform">
    <a name="caps-prop"></a>
    Transforming Text: the 'text-transform' property</h3>

    <table class="propdef">
        <tr>
          <th>Name:</th>
          <td><dfn>text-transform</dfn></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:
          <td>none | capitalize | uppercase | lowercase | full-width
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Initial:</th>
          <td>none</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Applies to:</th>
          <td>all elements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Inherited:</th>
          <td>yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Percentages:</th>
          <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Media:</th>
          <td>visual</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Computed&#160;value:</th>
          <td>as specified</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>This property transforms text for styling purposes.
      (It has no effect on the underlying content.)
      Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>No effects.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:capitalize">''capitalize''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts the first <i>letter</i> of each word in titlecase; other characters
          are unaffected.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:uppercase">''uppercase''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all <i>letters</i> in uppercase.
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:lowercase">''lowercase''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all <i>letters</i> in lowercase.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:full-width">''full-width''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in fullwidth form.
          If the character does not have a corresponding fullwidth form,
          it is left as is.
          This value is typically used to typeset Latin characters and digits
          like ideographic characters.
<!--
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:full-size-kana">''full-size-kana''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Converts all small Kana characters to normal Kana.
          The mappings for small Kana to normal Kana are defined in
          <a href="#small-kana">Small Kana Mappings</a>.</p>
        <p class=note>
          This value is typically used for ruby annotation text, 
          where due to the small type size, small Kana
          is often drawn as large Kana.
          This value allows such underlying text to use correct orthography
          so that it is accessible and can be styled correctly
          when not presented as ruby.
-->
    </dl>

    <p>The case mapping rules for the character repertoire specified by the
      Unicode Standard can be found on the Unicode Consortium Web site
      [[!UNICODE]]. The UA must use the full case mappings for Unicode
      characters, including any conditional casing rules, as defined in
      Default Case Algorithm section. If (and only if) the <i>content language</i>
      of the element is, according to the rules of the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/CSS21/conform.html#doclanguage">document language</a>,
      known,
      then any appropriate language-specific rules must be applied as well.
      These minimally include, but are not limited to, the language-specific
      rules in Unicode's
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/SpecialCasing.txt">SpecialCasing.txt</a>.

    <div class="example">
      <p>For example, in Turkish there are two &ldquo;i&rdquo;s, one with
        a dot&mdash;&ldquo;İ&rdquo; and &ldquo;i&rdquo;&mdash; and one
        without&mdash;&ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;ı&rdquo;. Thus the usual
        case mappings between &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;i&rdquo; are
        replaced with a different set of mappings to their respective
        undotted/dotted counterparts, which do not exist in English. This
        mapping must only take effect if the <i>content language</i> is Turkish
        (or another Turkic language that uses Turkish casing rules);
        in other languages, the usual mapping of &ldquo;I&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;i&rdquo; is required. This rule is thus conditionally
        defined in Unicode's SpecialCasing.txt file.
    </div>

<!--
    <div class="example">
      <p>An example where the UA may choose to include rules beyond those
        in Unicode is Greek. In Greek, if the entire word is in upper case
        (''text-transform: capitalize'' vs. ''text-transform: uppercase''),
        accents are dropped or transformed according to language-specific rules.
        http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/08/18/706383.aspx
    </div>
-->

    <p>The definition of "word" used for ''capitalize'' is UA-dependent;
      [[!UAX29]] is suggested (but not required) for determining such word
      boundaries. Authors should not expect ''capitalize'' to follow
      language-specific titlecasing conventions (such as skipping articles
      in English).

    <p>The definition of fullwidth and halfwidth forms can be found on the
      Unicode consortium web site at [[!UAX11]].
      The mapping to fullwidth form is defined by taking code points with
      the &lt;wide&gt; or the &lt;narrow&gt; tag in their Decomposition_Mapping
      in [[!UAX44]]. For the &lt;narrow&gt; tag, the mapping is from the code
      point to the decomposition (minus &lt;narrow&gt; tag), and for the
      &lt;wide&gt; tag, the mapping is from the decomposition (minus the
      &lt;wide&gt; tag) back to the original code point.</p>

    <p>Text transformation happens after <a href="#white-space-rules">white
      space processing</a>, which means that ''full-width'' transforms
      only preserved U+0020 spaces to U+3000.

    <div class="example">
      <p>The following example converts the ASCII characters in abbreviations
        in Japanese to their fullwidth variants so that they lay out and line
        break like ideographs:
      <pre>abbr:lang(ja) { text-transform: full-width; }</pre>
    </div>

    <p class="issue">CSS may introduce the ability to create custom mapping
      tables for less common text transforms, such as by an ''@text-transform''
      rule similar to ''@counter-style'' from [[CSS3LIST]].
<!--
      This mechanism may be used to replace ''full-size-kana''. This would
      require authors needing this functionality to copy out the conversion
      tables, however.
-->


<h2 id="white-space"><a id="white-space-collapsing"></a><a id='text-wrap'></a>
  White Space and Wrapping: the 'white-space' property</h2>

  <p>This property specifies two things:
  <ul>
    <li>whether and how <a href="#white-space-processing">white space</a> inside the element is collapsed
    <li>whether lines may <i>wrap</i> at unforced <i>soft wrap opportunities</i>
  </ul>

  <table class="propdef">
      <tr>
        <th>Name:</th>
        <td><dfn>white-space</dfn></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:
        <td>normal | pre | nowrap | pre-wrap | pre-line</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Initial:</th>
        <td>not defined for shorthand properties</td>

      <tr>
        <th>Computed&#160;value:</th>
        <td>see individual properties</td>
      </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Values have the following meanings, which must be interpreted
    according to
    the <a href="#white-space-rules">White Space Processing</a> and
    <a href="#line-breaking">Line Breaking</a> rules:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="white-space:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>This value directs user agents to collapse sequences of white space
      into a single character (or <a href="#line-break-transform">in some
      cases</a>, no character).
      Lines may wrap at allowed <i>soft wrap opportunities</i>,
      as determined by the line-breaking rules in effect,
      in order to minimize overflow.
    <dt><dfn title="white-space:pre">''pre''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences of white space.
      <i>Segment breaks</i> such as line feeds and carriage returns are preserved as <i>forced line breaks</i>.
      Lines only break at <i>forced line breaks</i>;
      content that does not fit within the block container overflows it.
    <dt><dfn title="white-space:nowrap">''nowrap''</dfn>
    <dd>Like ''normal'', this value collapses white space;
      but like ''pre'', it does not allow wrapping.
    <dt><dfn title="white-space:pre-wrap">''pre-wrap''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Like ''pre'', this value preserves white space;
      but like ''normal'', it allows wrapping.
    <dt><dfn title="white-space:pre-line">''pre-line''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Like ''normal'', this value collapses consecutive spaces and allows wrapping,
      but preserves <i>segment breaks</i> in the source as <i>forced line breaks</i>.
  </dl>

  <p class="issue">
    There have been requests for the ability to "discard" white space;
    the current definition has no facility for this.

  <p>The following informative table summarizes the behavior of various
    'white-space' values:</p>

  <table class="data">

  <p>See <a href="#white-space-processing">White Space Processing Rules</a>
    for details on how white space collapses. An informative summary of
    collapsing (''normal'' and ''nowrap'') is presented below:
    <ul>
      <li>A sequence of segment breaks and other white space between two
        Chinese, Japanese, or Yi characters collapses into nothing.
      <li>A zero width space before or after a white space sequence
        containing a segment break causes the entire sequence of white space
        to collapse into a zero width space.
      <li>Otherwise, consecutive white space collapses into a single space.
    </ul>

  <p>See <a href="#line-breaking">Line Breaking</a>
    for details on wrapping behavior.

<h2 id="white-space-processing">
  White Space Processing Details</h2>

  <p>The source text of a document often contains formatting
    that is not relevant to the final rendering: for example,
    <a href="http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/"
    >breaking the source into segments</a> (lines) for ease of editing
    or adding white space characters such as tabs and spaces to indent the source code.
    CSS white space processing allows the author to control interpretation of such formatting:
    to preserve or collapse it away when rendering the document.
    White space processing in CSS interprets white space characters only for rendering:
    it has no effect on the underlying document data.

  <p>White space processing in CSS is controlled with the 'white-space' property.

  <p id="segment-normalization">
    CSS does not define document segmentation rules. Segments could be
    separated by a particular newline seqence (such as a line feed or
    CRLF pair), or delimited by some other mechanism, such as the SGML
    RECORD-START and RECORD-END tokens.
    For CSS processing, each document language&ndash;defined segment break,
    CRLF sequence (U+000D U+000A), carriage return (U+000D), and line feed (U+000A)
    in the text is treated as a <dfn>segment break</dfn>,
    which is then interpreted for rendering as specified by the 'white-space' property.

  <p class="note">Note that the document parser may have not only normalized
    any segment breaks, but also collapsed other space characters or
    otherwise processed white space according to markup rules. Because CSS
    processing occurs <em>after</em> the parsing stage, it is not possible
    to restore these characters for styling. Therefore, some of the
    behavior specified below can be affected by these limitations and
    may be user agent dependent.</p>

  <p class="note">Note that anonymous inlines consisting entirely of
    <i>collapsible</i> white space are removed from the rendering tree.
    See [[CSS21]] section
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous">9.2.2.1</a></p>

  <p>Control characters (Unicode class Cc) other than tab (U+0009), line feed

    The White Space Processing Rules</h3>

    <p>White space processing affects only spaces (U+0020), tabs (U+0009),
      and <a href="#segment-normalization">segment breaks</a>.

    <p>For each inline (including anonymous inlines) within an inline
      formatting context, white space characters are handled as follows,
      ignoring bidi formatting characters as if they were not there:</p>

    <ul>
    <li id="collapse"><p>If 'white-space' is set to
      ''normal'', ''nowrap'', or ''pre-line'',
      white space characters are considered <dfn>collapsible</dfn>
      and are processed by performing the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>All spaces and tabs immediately preceding or following a segment
          break are removed.</li>
        <li>Segment breaks are transformed for
          rendering according to the <a href="#line-break-transform">line
          break transformation rules</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Every tab is converted to a space (U+0020).</li>
        <li>Any space immediately following another collapsible space
          &mdash;even one outside the boundary of the inline containing
          the space, provided they are within the same inline formatting
          context&mdash;is collapsed to have zero advance width. (It is
          invisible, but retains its <i>soft wrap opportunity</i>, if any.)</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><p>If 'white-space' is set to ''pre-wrap'', any sequence of
      spaces is treated as a sequence of non-breaking spaces. However,
      a <i>soft wrap opportunity</i> exists at the end of the sequence.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then, the entire block is rendered. Inlines are laid out, taking bidi
      reordering into account, and <i>wrapping</i> as specified by the
      'white-space' property.</p>

    <p>As each line is laid out,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A sequence of collapsible spaces at the beginning of a line is
        removed.
      <li>Each tab is rendered as a horizontal shift
        that lines up the start edge of the next glyph with the next tab stop.
        <dfn>Tab stops</dfn> occur at points that are multiples of the <i>tab size</i>
        from the block's starting content edge.
        The <dfn>tab size</dfn> is given by the 'tab-size' property.
      <li>A sequence of <i>collapsible</i> spaces at the end of a line is removed.
      <li>If spaces or tabs at the end of a line are non-collapsible but
         have 'text-wrap' set to 'normal' the UA may visually
         collapse their character advance widths.
    </ol>

    <p>White space that was not removed or collapsed during the white space
      processing steps is called <dfn>preserved</dfn> white space.</p>

    <div class="example">
    <h4 id="egbidiwscollapse">
      Example of bidirectionality with white space collapsing</h4>

      <p>Consider the following markup fragment, taking special note of spaces
        (with varied backgrounds and borders for emphasis and identification):
        </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;ltr&gt;A<span class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span>&lt;rtl&gt;<span class="egbidiwsbB">&#160;</span>B<span class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>&lt;/rtl&gt;<span class="egbidiwsbC">&#160;</span>C&lt;/ltr&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>where the <code>&lt;ltr&gt;</code> element represents a left-to-right
        embedding and the <code>&lt;rtl&gt;</code> element represents a
        right-to-left embedding. If the 'text-space-collapse' property is set
        to ''collapse'', the above processing model would result in the
        following:</p>

      <ul style="line-height:1.3">
        <li>The space before the B (<span class="egbidiwsbB">&#160;</span>)
          would collapse with the space after the A (<span
          class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span>).</li>
        <li>The space before the C (<span class="egbidiwsbC">&#160;</span>)
          would collapse with the space after the B (<span
          class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This would leave two spaces, one after the A in the left-to-right
        embedding level, and one after the B in the right-to-left embedding
        level. This is then ordered according to the Unicode bidirectional
        algorithm, with the end result being:</p>

      <pre>A<span class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span><span class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>BC</pre>

      <p>Note that there are two spaces between A and B, and none between B
        and C. This is best avoided by putting spaces outside the element
        instead of just inside the opening and closing tags and, where
        practical, by relying on implicit bidirectionality instead of explicit
        embedding levels.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="line-break-transform">
      Line Break Transformation Rules</h4>

      <p>When 'white-space' is ''pre'', ''pre-wrap'', or ''pre-line'',
      <i>segment breaks</i> are not <i>collapsible</i>
      and are instead transformed into a preserved line feed (U+000A).

      <p>For other values of 'white-space', <i>segment breaks</i> are <i>collapsible</i>,
        and are either transformed into a space (U+0020) or removed
        depending on the context before and after the break:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the character immediately before or immediately after the segment
          break is the zero-width space character (U+200B), then the break
          is removed, leaving behind the zero-width space.
        <li>Otherwise, if the East Asian Width property [[!UAX11]] of both
          the character before and after the line feed is F, W, or H (not A),
          and neither side is Hangul, then the segment break is removed.
        <li>Otherwise, the segment break is converted to a space (U+0020).
      </ul>

      <p class="note">Note that the white space processing rules have already
        removed any tabs and spaces after the segment break before these checks
        take place.</p>

      <p class="issue">Comments on how well this would work in practice would
        be very much appreciated, particularly from people who work with
        Thai and similar scripts.</p>

      <p class="issue">Is this our only dependency on EAW? If so, are we sure

    <p>This property determines the <i>tab size</i> used to render preserved tab characters (U+0009).
      Integers represent the measure as multiples of the space character's advance width (U+0020).
      Negative values are not allowed.

<h2 id="line-breaking">
  Line Breaking and Word Boundaries</h2>

  <p>When inline-level content is laid out into lines, it is broken across line boxes.
    Such a break is called a <dfn>line break</dfn>.
    When a line is broken due to explicit line-breaking controls,
    or due to the start or end of a block,
    it is a <dfn>forced line break</dfn>.
    When a line is broken due to content <dfn title="wrapping|wrap">wrapping</dfn>
    (i.e. when the UA creates unforced line breaks in order to fit the content within the measure),
    it is a <dfn>soft wrap break</dfn>.
    The process of breaking inline-level content into lines is called <dfn>line breaking</dfn>.

  <p>Wrapping is only performed at an allowed break point, called a <dfn>soft wrap opportunity</dfn>.

  <p>In most writing systems,
    in the absence of hyphenation a <i>soft wrap opportunity</i> occurs only at word boundaries.
    Many such systems use spaces or punctuation to explicitly separate words,
    and <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> can be identified by these characters.
    Scripts such as Thai, Lao, and Khmer, however,
    do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words.
    Although the zero width space (U+200B) can be used as an explicit word delimiter in these scripts,
    this practice is not common.
    As a result, a lexical resource is needed to correctly identify <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> in such texts.

  <p>In several other writing systems, (including Chinese, Japanese, Yi, and sometimes also Korean)
    a <i>soft wrap opportunity</i> is based on syllable boundaries, not word boundaries.
    In these systems a line can break anywhere <em>except</em> between certain character combinations.
    Additionally the level of strictness in these restrictions can vary with the typesetting style.</p>

  <p>CSS does not fully define where <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> occur,
    however some controls are provided to distinguish common variations.

  <div class="note">
    <p>Further information on line breaking conventions can be found in
      [[JLREQ]] and [[JIS4051]] for Japanese,
      [[ZHMARK]] for Chinese, and
      in [[!UAX14]] for all scripts in Unicode.
      <!-- The CSS Working Group notes that although UAX 14 contains a wealth of
      information about line breaking conventions, a literal implementation
      of its algorithm has been found to be inadequate in multiple situations. -->

    <p class="issue">Any guidance for appropriate references here would be
      much appreciated.

<h3 id="line-break-details">
Line Breaking Details</h3>

  <p>When determining <i>line breaks</i>:
  <ul>
    <li>Regardless of the 'white-space' value,
      lines always break at each <i>preserved</i> forced break character:
      for all values, line-breaking behavior defined for
      the BK, CR, LF, CM, NL, and SG line breaking classes in [[!UAX14]]
      must be honored.
    <li>When 'white-space' allows wrapping,
      line breaking behavior defined for the WJ, ZW, and GL line-breaking classes in [[!UAX14]]
      must be honored.
    <li>UAs that allow wrapping at punctuation other than spaces should prioritize breakpoints.
      For example, if breaks after slashes are given a lower priority than spaces,
      the sequence "check /etc" will never break between the '/' and the 'e'.
      The UA may use the width of the containing block, the text's language,
      and other factors in assigning priorities.
      As long as care is taken to avoid such awkward breaks, allowing breaks at
      appropriate punctuation other than spaces is recommended, as it results
      in more even-looking margins, particularly in narrow measures.
    <li>Out-of-flow elements do not introduce a <i>forced line break</i>
      or <i>soft wrap opportunity</i> in the flow.
    <li>The line breaking behavior of a replaced element or other atomic inline
      is equivalent to that of the Object Replacement Character (U+FFFC).
    <li>For <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> created by characters that disappear at the line break (e.g. U+0020 SPACE),
      properties on the element containing that character control the line breaking at that opportunity.
      For <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> defined by the boundary between two characters,
      the properties on the element containing the boundary control breaking.
      <!-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Dec/0043.html -->
    <li>For <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> before the first or after the last character of a box,
      the break occurs immediately before/after the box (at its margin edge)
      rather than breaking the box between its content edge and the content.
    <li>For line breaking in/around <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ruby/">ruby</a>,
      the base text is considered part of the same inline formatting context as its surrouding content,
      but the ruby text is not:
      i.e. line breaking opportunities between the ruby element and its surrounding content
      are determined as if the ruby base were inline and the ruby text were not there.

    <p>This property specifies the strictness of line-breaking rules applied
      within an element:
      particularly how <i>wrapping</i> interacts with punctuation and symbols.
      Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="line-break:auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The UA determines the set of line-breaking restrictions to use,
        and it may vary the restrictions based on the length of the line; e.g.,
        use a less restrictive set of line-break rules for short lines.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="line-break:loose">''loose''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Breaks text using the least restrictive set of line-breaking
        rules. Typically used for short lines, such as in newspapers.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="line-break:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Breaks text using the most common set of line-breaking rules.</dd>

      <dd>Breaks text using the most stringent set of line-breaking
        rules.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>CSS distinguishes between three levels of strictness in the rules for
      text wrapping.
      The precise set of rules in effect for each level is up to the UA
      and should follow language conventions.
      However, this specification does recommend that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Following breaks be forbidden in ''strict'' line breaking and
        allowed in ''normal'' and ''loose'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before Japanese <a href="#small-kana">small kana</a>
          <li>breaks before the Katakana-Hiragana prolonged sound mark:
            &#x30FC;&nbsp;U+30FC,  &#xFF70&nbsp;U+FF70
        </ul>
        If the <i>content language</i> is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, then additionally:
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before hyphens:<br>
            &#x2010;&nbsp;U+2010,  &#x2013;&nbsp;U+2013,  &#x301C;&nbsp;U+301C,
            &#x30A0;&nbsp;U+30A0
        </ul>
      <li>Following breaks be forbidden in ''normal'' and ''strict'' line
        breaking and allowed in ''loose'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before iteration marks:<br>
            &#x3005;&nbsp;U+3005,  &#x303B;&nbsp;U+303B,  &#x309D;&nbsp;U+309D,

          <li>breaks between some inseparable characters:<br>
            &#x2025;&nbsp;U+2025,  &#x2026;&nbsp;U+2026
        </ul>
        If the <i>content language</i> is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, then additionally:
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before certain centered punctuation marks:<br>

            &#x2103;&nbsp;U+2103,  &#xFF05;&nbsp;U+FF05,  &#xFFE0;&nbsp;U+FFE0
          <li>breaks after prefixes:<br>
            &#x0024;&nbsp;U+0024,  &#x00A3;&nbsp;U+00A3,  &#x00A5;&nbsp;U+00A5,

            &#xFFE1;&nbsp;U+FFE1,  &#xFFE5;&nbsp;U+FFE5
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">In the recommended list above, no distinction is made among the levels of
      strictness in non-CJK text: only CJK codepoints are affected, unless
      the text is marked as Chinese or Japanese, in which case some additional
      common codepoints are affected. However a future level of CSS may add
      behaviors affecting non-CJK text.

    <p>Support for this property is <em>optional</em>. It is recommended
      for UAs that wish to support CJK typography and strongly recommended
      for UAs in the Japanese market.</p>

    <p class="note">The CSSWG recognizes that in a future edition of the
      specification finer control over line breaking may be necessary to
      satisfy high-end publishing requirements.

<h2 id="hyphenation">Hyphenation</h2>

    <p><dfn title="hyphenation|hyphenate">Hyphenation</dfn>
      allows the controlled splitting of words
      to improve the layout of paragraphs,
      typically splitting words at syllabic or morphemic boundaries
      and visually indicating the split (usually with a hyphen).
      Hyphenation occurs when the line breaks at a valid <dfn>hyphenation opportunity</dfn>,
      which creates a <i>soft wrap opportunity</i> within the word.

    <p>Hyphenation in CSS is controlled with the 'hyphens' property.
      CSS Text Level 3 does not define the exact rules for hyphenation,
      however UAs are strongly encouraged to optimize their line-breaking implementation
      to choose good break points and appropriate hyphenation points.

    <p>Hyphenation opportunities <em>are</em> considered when calculating
      ''min-content'' intrinsic sizes.
    <!-- This is because it allows tables to hyphenate instead of overflowing,
         which is particularly important in long-word languages like German.

    <p>This property controls whether hyphenation is allowed to create more
      <i>soft wrap opportunities</i> within a line of text.
      Values have the following meanings:

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="hyphens:none">''none''</dfn>
        <dd>Words are not hyphenated, even if characters inside
          the word explicitly define hyphenation opportunities.
      <dt><dfn title="hyphens:manual">''manual''</dfn>
        <dd>Words are only hyphenated where there are characters inside the word
          that explicitly suggest hyphenation opportunities.
          <!-- Characters can be <del>explicit</del><ins>???</ins> or conditional. -->
        <div class="example">
        <p>In Unicode, U+00AD is a conditional "soft hyphen" and U+2010 is an
          unconditional hyphen. Unicode Standard Annex #14 describes the
          <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SoftHyphen">role of soft hyphens in</a>
          Unicode line breaking. [[!UAX14]]
          In HTML, &amp;shy; represents the soft hyphen character which

        </div>
      <dt><dfn title="hyphens:auto">''auto''</dfn>
        <dd>Words may be broken at appropriate hyphenation points either
          as determined by hyphenation characters inside the word or
          as determined automatically by a language-appropriate hyphenation resource.
          Conditional hyphenation characters inside a word, if present,
          take priority over automatic resources when determining
          hyphenation opportunities within the word.
    </dl>

    <p>Correct automatic hyphenation requires a hyphenation resource
      appropriate to the language of the text being broken. The UA is
      therefore only required to automatically hyphenate text for which
      the author has declared a language (e.g. via HTML <code>lang</code>
      or XML <code>xml:lang</code>) and for which it has an appropriate
      hyphenation resource.

    <p>When shaping scripts such as Arabic are allowed to break within words
      due to hyphenation, the characters must still be shaped as if the word
      were not broken.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>For example, if the word &ldquo;&#x0646;&#x0648;&#x0634;&#x062A;&#x0646;&#x0646;&rdquo;

    <p>This property specifies whether the UA may arbitrarily break within a word

      'white-space' allows <i>wrapping</i>. Possible values:</p>

    <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="overflow-wrap:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lines may break only at allowed break points. However, the restrictions
      introduced by ''word-break: keep-all'' may be relaxed to match
      ''word-break: normal'' <!-- and the various hyphenation limit properties
      may be ignored --> if there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in
      the line.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="overflow-wrap:break-word">''break-word''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>An unbreakable "word" may be broken at an arbitrary point if
      there are no otherwise-acceptable break points in the line.
      Shaping characters are still shaped as if the word were not
      broken, and grapheme clusters must together stay as one unit.
      No hyphenation character is inserted at the break point.
    </dl>

    <p><i>Soft wrap opportunities</i> not part of ''overflow-wrap: normal'' line breaking
       are not considered when calculating ''min-content'' intrinsic sizes.

    <p>For legacy reasons, UAs must treat 'word-wrap' as an alternate name
      for the 'overflow-wrap' property, as if it were a shorthand of 'overflow-wrap'.

    <p>A block of text is a stack of

      In the case of 'start', 'end', 'left', 'right' and 'center', this

      'word-spacing'.)
      If an element's white space is not <a href="#collapse">collapsible</a>,
      then the UA is not required to adjust its text for the purpose of justification
      and may instead treat the text as having no <i>expansion opportunities</i>.
      If the UA chooses to adjust the text, then it must ensure
      that tab stops continue to line up as required by the

<h4 id=bidi-linebox>
Bidirectionality and Line Boxes</h4>

    <p>The start and end edges of a line box are determined by
      the inline base direction of the line box.
      In most cases, this is given by its containing block's computed 'direction'.
      However if its containing block has ''unicode-bidi: plaintext'' [[!CSS3-WRITING-MODES]],
      the inline base direction the line box must be determined
      by the base direction of the bidi paragraph to which it belongs:
      that is, the bidi paragraph for which the line box holds content.
      An empty line box
      (i.e. one that contains no atomic inlines or
       characters other than the line-breaking character, if any),
      takes its inline base direction from the preceding line box (if any), or,
      if this is the first line box in the containing block,
      then from the 'direction' property of the containing block.

    <div class="example">
      <p>In the following example, assuming the <code>&lt;block&gt;</code>
      is a preformatted block (''display: block; white-space: pre'') inheriting
      ''text-align: start'', every other line is right-aligned:</p>
      <pre>&lt;block style="unicode-bidi: plaintext"&gt;
<!-- -->  Latin
<!-- -->  &#x0648;·&#x06A9;&#x0645;&#x06CC;
<!-- -->  Latin
<!-- -->  &#x0648;·&#x06A9;&#x0645;&#x06CC;
<!-- -->  Latin
<!-- -->  &#x0648;·&#x06A9;&#x0645;&#x06CC;
<!-- -->&lt;/block&gt;</pre>
    </div>

    <p class="note">Note that the inline base direction determined here
    applies to the line box itself, and not to its contents.
    It affects 'text-align', 'text-align-last', 'text-indent', and 'hanging-punctuation',
    i.e. the position and alignment of its contents with respect to its edges.
    It does not affect the formatting or ordering of its content.

    <div class="example">
      <p>In the following example:
      <pre>
<!-- -->&lt;para style="display: block; direction: rtl; unicode-bidi:plaintext">
<!-- -->&lt;quote style="unicode-bidi:plaintext">שלום!&lt;/quote>", he said.
<!-- -->&lt;/para&gt;</pre>

      <p>The result should be a left-aligned line looking like this:
      <pre>"!&#1513;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501;", he said.</pre>

      <p>The line is left-aligned
        (despite the containing block having ''direction: rtl'')
        because the containing block (the <code>&lt;para></code>) has ''unicode-bidi:plaintext'',
        and the line box belongs to a bidi paragraph that is LTR.
        This is because that paragraph's first character with a strong direction
        is the LTR "h" from "he". The RTL "שלום!" does precede the "he",
        but it sits in its own bidi-isolated paragraph that is <em>not</em>
        immediately contained by the <code>&lt;para&gt;</code>,
        and is thus irrelevent to the line box's alignment.
        From from the standpoint of the bidi paragraph immediately contained
        by the <code>&lt;para&gt;</code> containing block,
        the <code>&lt;quote&gt;</code>&rsquo;s bidi-isolated paragraph inside it is,
        by definition, just a neutral U+FFFC character,
        so the immediately-contained paragraph becomes LTR by virtue
        of the "he" following it.
    </div>

    <div class="example">
      <pre>
<!-- -->&lt;fieldset style="direction: rtl">
<!-- -->&lt;textarea style="unicode-bidi:plaintext">
<!-- -->
<!-- -->Hello!
<!-- -->
<!-- -->&lt;/textarea>
<!-- -->&lt;/fieldset></pre>

      <p>As expected, the "Hello!" should be displayed LTR
        (i.e. with the exclamation mark on the right end,
        despite the <code>&lt;textarea></code>'s ''direction:rtl'')
        and left-aligned.
        This makes the empty line following it left-aligned as well,
        which means that the caret on that line should appear at its
        left edge. The first empty line, on the other hand, should
        be right-aligned, due to the RTL direction of its containing
        paragraph, the <code>&lt;textarea></code>.
    </div>

  <h4 id="character-alignment">Character-based Alignment in a Table Column</h4>

    <p>When multiple cells in a column have an <i>alignment character</i> specified,
      the alignment character of each such cell in the column is centered along
      a single column-parallel axis and the rest of the text in the column
      shifted accordingly. (Note that the strings do not have to be the same
      for each cell, although they usually are.)

    <div class="example">
      The following style sheet:
      <pre>TD { text-align: "." center }</pre>
      will cause the column of dollar figures in the following HTML table:

      <pre class="html-example">

      <p>to align along the decimal point. The table might be rendered as
        follows:</P>
      <pre>

    </div>

    <p>A keyword value may be specified in conjunction with the &lt;string&gt;
      value; if it is not given, it defaults to ''right''. This value is used:
    <ul>
      <li>when character-based alignment is applied to boxes that are not table
        cells.
      <li>when the text wraps to multiple lines (at unforced break points).
      <li>when a character-aligned cell spans more than one column. In this
        case the keyword alignment value is used to determine which column's
        axis to align with: the leftmost column for ''left'', the rightmost
        column for ''right'' and ''center'', the startmost column for ''start'',
        the endmost column for ''end''.
      <li>when the column is wide enough that the character alignment alone does
        not determine the positions of its character-aligned contents. In this
        case the keyword alignment of the first cell in the column with a
        specified alignment character is used to slide the position of the
        character-aligned contents to match the keyword alignment insofar as
        possible without changing the width of the column.
        For ''center'', the UA may center
        the aligned contents using its extremes, center the alignment axis
        itself (insofar as possible), or optically center the aligned contents
        some other way (such as by taking a weighted average of the extent of
        the cells' contents to either side of the axis).
    </ul>

    <p class="note">Right alignment is used by default for character-based
      alignment because numbering systems are almost all left-to-right even
      in right-to-left writing systems, and the primary use case of
      character-based alignment is for numerical alignment.</p>

    <p>If the alignment character appears more than once in the text, the first
      instance is used for alignment. If the alignment character does not appear
      in a cell at all, the string is aligned as if the alignment character had
      been inserted at the end of its contents.

    <p>Character-based alignment occurs before table cell width computation so
      that auto width computations can leave enough space for alignment.
      Whether column-spanning cells participate in the alignment prior to
      or after width computation is undefined.
      If width constraints on the cell contents prevent full alignment
      throughout the column, the resulting alignment is undefined.

    <p>This property selects the justification method used when a line's
      alignment is set to ''justify'' (see 'text-align'), primarily by
      controlling which scripts' characters are adjusted together or
      separately.
      The property applies to block containers, but the UA may (but
      is not required to) also support it on inline elements.
      It takes the following values:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-justify:auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The UA determines the justification algorithm to follow, based
          on a balance between performance and adequate presentation quality.
          <p class="note">One possible algorithm is to determine the behavior
          based on the language of the paragraph: the UA can then choose
          appropriate value for the language, like ''inter-ideograph''
          for CJK, or ''inter-word'' for English.
          Another possibility is to use a justification method that is a
          universal compromise for all scripts, e.g. the ''inter-cluster''
          method with block scripts raised to first priority.</p>

        <dfn title="text-justify:kashida">''kashida''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Justification primarily stretches
          <a href="#cursive-scripts">cursive scripts</a> through the use of
          kashida or other calligraphic elongation.
          This value is <em>optional</em> for conformance to CSS3 Text.
          (UAs that do not support cursive elongation must
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-2010/#partial">treat the value
          as invalid</a>.)
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When justifying text, the user agent takes the remaining space between
      the ends of a line's contents and the edges of its line box, and
      distributes that space throughout its contents so that the contents
      exactly fill the line box. If the 'letter-spacing' and 'word-spacing'
      property values allow it, the user agent may also distribute negative
      space, putting more content on the line than would otherwise fit under
      normal spacing conditions. The exact justification algorithm is
      UA-dependent; however, CSS provides some general guidelines which should
      be followed when any justification method other than 'auto' is
      specified.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>The guidelines in this level of CSS do not describe a complete
      justification algorithm. They are merely a minimum set of requirements
      that a complete algorithm should meet. Limiting the set of requirements
      gives UAs some latitude in choosing a justification algorithm that
      meets their needs.

      <p>For instance, a basic but fast ''inter-word'' justification algorithm
      might use a simple greedy method for determining line breaks, then
      distribute leftover space using the <a href="#spacing">spacing limits
      provided</a>. This algorithm could follow the guidelines by expanding
      word spaces first, expanding between letters only if 'word-spacing' hit
      a limit.

      <p>A more sophisticated but slower ''inter-word'' justification algorithm
      might use a Knuth/Plass method where <i>expansion opportunities</i> and
      limits were assigned weights and assessed with other line breaking
      considerations. This algorithm could follow the guidelines by giving
      more weight to word spaces than letter spacing. 
    </div>

    <p>CSS defines <dfn id="expansion-opportunity" title="expansion opportunity">expansion opportunities</dfn>
      as points where the justification algorithm may alter spacing within
      the text. These <i>expansion opportunities</i> fall into priority
      levels as defined by the justification method. Within a line, expansion
      and compression should primarily target the first-priority expansion
      opportunities; lower priority expansion opportunities are adjusted at a
      lower priority as needed.

    <p>Expansion and compression limits are given by the
      <a href="#letter-spacing">letter-spacing</a>
      and <a href="#word-spacing">word-spacing</a> properties.
      How any remaining space is distributed once all <i>expansion opportunities</i>
      reach their limits is up to the UA. If the inline contents of a line
      cannot be stretched to the full width of the line box, then they must be
      aligned as specified by the 'text-align-last' property. (If
      'text-align-last' is ''justify'', then they must be aligned as for
      ''center'' if 'text-justify' is ''distribute'' and as ''start''
      otherwise.)</p>

    <p>The <i>expansion opportunity</i> priorities for values of 'text-justify'
      are given in the table below. Since justification behavior
      varies by writing system, <i>expansion opportunities</i> are organized by
      <a href="#script-groups">script categories</a>.
      An <i>expansion opportunity</i> exists between two <i>letters</i> at a
      priority level when at least one of them belongs to a script category
      at that level and the other does not belong to a higher priority level.
      All scripts in the same priority level must be treated exactly the same.
      Word separators (spaces) and other symbols and punctuation are treated
      specially, see below.

    <p id="auto-justify"><small>* The ''auto'' column defined above is informative; it
      suggests a prioritization that presents a universal compromise among
      justification methods.</small></p>
    <p id="justify-spaces">The <dfn title="spaces-category">spaces</dfn> category represents
      <i>expansion opportunities</i> at <a href="#word-separator">word separators</a>.
      (See <a href="#word-spacing">'word-spacing'</a>.)
      Except when 'text-justify' is ''distribute'', the UA may treat
      spaces differently than other <i>expansion opportunities</i> in the same priority,
      but must not change their priority with respect to <i>expansion opportunities</i>
      in other priority levels. For example, in Japanese ''inter-ideograph''
      justification (which treats CJK characters at a higher priority than
      Latin characters), word spaces traditionally have a higher priority
      than inter-CJK spacing, and the UA may split the 1st-priority level
      to implement that. However the UA is not allowed to drop either spaces
      or CJK characters to the same priority as Latin characters.
    <p id="justify-symbols">The <dfn id="punctuation-symbols">symbols</dfn>
      category represents the <i>expansion opportunity</i> existing at or between
      any pair of characters from the Unicode Symbols (S*) and Punctuation (P*)
      classes.
      The default justification priority of these <i>expansion opportunities</i> is given above.
      However, there may be additional rules controlling their justification
      behavior due to typographic tradition. Therefore, the UA may reassign
      specific characters or introduce additional levels of prioritization
      to handle <i>expansion opportunities</i> involving symbols and punctuation.
      For example, there are traditionally no <i>expansion opportunities</i>
      between consecutive EM DASH U+2014, HORIZONTAL BAR U+2015, HORIZONTAL
      ELLIPSIS U+2026, or TWO DOT LEADER U+2025 characters [[JLREQ]]; thus
      a UA might assign these characters to the "never" prioritization level.
      As another example, certain fullwidth punctuation characters are
      considered to contain an <i>expansion opportunity</i> (see 'text-spacing').
      The UA might therefore assign these characters to a higher prioritization
      level than the opportunities between ideographic characters.

    <p id="justify-cursive">For justification of <i>cursive scripts</i>,
      words may be expanded through kashida elongation or other cursive
      expansion processes. Kashida may be applied in discrete units or
      continuously, and the prioritization of kashida opportunities is UA-dependent:
      for example, the UA may apply more at the end of the line. The
      UA should not apply kashida to fonts for which it is inappropriate.
      It may instead rely on other justification methods that lengthen
      or shorten Arabic segments (e.g. by substituting in swash forms or
      optional ligatures). Because elongation rules depend on the typeface
      style, the UA should rely on on the font whenever possible rather
      than inserting kashida based on a font-independent ruleset. The UA
      should limit elongation so that, e.g. in multi-script lines a short
      stretch of Arabic will not be forced to soak up too much of the
      extra space by itself. If the UA does not support cursive elongation,
      then, as with connected scripts, no <i>expansion opportunities</i> exist between
      characters of these scripts.

    <p>The UA may enable or break optional ligatures or use other font
      features such as alternate glyphs or glyph compression to help
      justify the text under any method. This behavior is not controlled by
      this level of CSS.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>3.8 Line Adjustment in [[JLREQ]] gives an example of a set of rules for
        how a text formatter can justify Japanese text.
        It describes rules for cases where the 'text-justify' property is ''inter-ideograph''
        and the 'text-spacing' property does not specify ''no-compress''.</p>
      <p>It produces an effect similar to cases where
        the computed value of 'text-spacing' property does not specify
        ''trim-end'' or ''space-end''.
        If the UA wants to prohibit this behavior,
        rule b. of 3.8.3 should be omitted.</p>
      <p>Note that the rules described in the document specifically target Japanese.
        Therefore they may produce non-optimal results
        when used to justify other languages such as English.
        To make the rules more applicable to other scripts,
        the UA could, for instance,
        omit the rule to compress half-width spaces (rule a. of 3.8.3).</p>

  Spacing</h2>

  <p>CSS offers control over text spacing via the 'word-spacing'
  and 'letter-spacing' properties. While in CSS1 and CSS2 these could only
  be ''normal'' (justifiable) or a fixed length, CSS3 can indicate range
  constraints to control flexibility in justification.
  In addition the 'word-spacing' property can now be specified in
  percentages, making it possible to, for example, double or eliminate
  word spacing.

  <div class="example">
    <p>In the following example, word spacing is halved, but may expand up
    to its full amount if needed for text justification.
    <pre>p { word-spacing: -50% 0%; }</pre>
  </div>

  <p id="spacing-limits">The <dfn>&lt;spacing-limits&gt;</dfn> value type,
    which represents optimum, minimum, and maximum spacing in 'word-spacing'
    and 'letter-spacing', is defined as
  <pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;spacing-limits></dfn> = [ normal | &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt;]{1,3}</pre>

  <p>If three values are specified, they represent the optimum, minimum,
    and maximum in that order.
    If only two values are specified, then the first represents both the
    optimum and the minimum, and the second represents the maximum.

    minimum, and maximum. The values are interpreted as defined below:

  <p>In the absence of justification the optimum spacing is be used.
    The text justification process may alter the spacing
    from its optimum (see the <a href="#text-justify">'text-justify'</a>
    property, above) but must not violate the minimum spacing limit
    and should also avoid exceeding the maximum.
    The UA may also use the difference between the minimum/maximum limits
    and the optimum as input into a weighting algorithm for justification.

  <p>The minimum is treated as a hard constraint: if the maximum is less
    than the minimum, then the used it is set to the minimum. Likewise
    for the optimum. Similarly if the maximum is less than the optimum,
    then the used optimum is set to the used maximum.

   <p><dfn id="normal-spacing">Normal spacing</dfn>:
    Although ''normal'' minimum and maximum spacing limits are UA-defined,
    they must be defined relative to the optimum so that the limits
    increase and decrease with changes to the optimum spacing.
    Normal limits may also vary according to
    the value of the <a href="#text-justify">'text-justify'</a> property,
    the element's language,
    some measure of the amount of text on a line (e.g. block width divided by font size),
    and/or other factors.

    <p>Additional spacing is applied to each word-separator character

    <p>This property specifies the minimum, maximum, and optimal spacing
      between <i>characters</i>.
      Letter-spacing is applied in addition to any word-spacing.

    <p>Letter-spacing must not be applied at the beginning or at the end
       of a line. At element boundaries, the total letter spacing between
       two characters is given by and rendered within the innermost element
       that <em>contains</em> the boundary.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of letter-spacing, each consecutive run of atomic
      inlines (such as image and/or inline blocks) is treated as a single
      <i>character</i>.

    <div class="example">
      <p>For example, given the markup</p>

      <pre>&lt;P&gt;a&lt;LS&gt;b&lt;Z&gt;cd&lt;/Z&gt;&lt;Y&gt;ef&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/LS&gt;g&lt;/P&gt;</pre>

      <pre><!--
     -->LS { letter-spacing: 1em; }
<!-- -->Z { letter-spacing: 0.3em; }
<!-- -->Y { letter-spacing: 0.4em; }</pre>

      <p>the spacing would be</p>

      <pre>a[0]b[1em]c[0.3em]d[1em]e[0.4em]f[0]g</pre>
    </div>

    <p>UAs may apply letter-spacing to cursive scripts. In this case, UAs
      should extend the space between disjoint characters as specified above
      <em>and</em> extend the visible connection between cursively connected
      characters by the same amount (rather than leaving a gap). The UA may
      use glyph substitution or other font capabilities to spread out the
      letters. If the UA  cannot expand a cursive script without breaking
      the cursive connections, it should not apply letter-spacing between
      characters of that script at all.</p>

    <p>Letter-spacing ignores zero-width characters (such as those from the
      Unicode Cf category). For example, 'letter-spacing' applied to
      <code>A&amp;zwsp;B</code> is identical to <code>AB</code>.

    <p>When the effective letter-spacing between two characters is not zero
      (due to either <a href="#text-justify">justification</a>
      or a non-zero specified optimum),
      user agents should not apply optional ligatures.</p>

<h2 id="edge-effects">
  Edge Effects</h2>

  <p>Edge effects control the indentation of lines with respect to other lines

    <p>This property specifies the indentation applied to lines of inline
      content in a block. The indent is treated as a margin applied to
      the start edge of the line box. Unless otherwise specified via the
      ''each-line'' and/or ''hanging'' keywords, only lines that are the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-line-pseudo">first

    <p>This property determines whether a punctuation mark, if one is present,
      <i>hangs</i> and may be placed outside the line box (or in the indent)
      at the start or at the end of a line of text.

    <p class="note">Note that if there is not sufficient padding on the
      block container, 'hanging-punctuation' can trigger overflow.</p>

    <p>When a punctuation mark <dfn title="hang">hangs</dfn>, it is not considered
      when measuring the line's contents for fit, alignment, or justification.
      Depending on the line's alignment, this may (or may not)
      result in the mark being placed outside the line box.

    <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

    </dl>

    <p>Non-zero start and end borders/padding between
      a <i>hang</i>eable mark and the edge of the line prevent the mark from hanging.
      For example, a period at the end of an inline box with end padding
      does not <i>hang</i> at the end edge of a line.
      At most one punctuation character may <i>hang</i> at each edge of the line.

    <p>A <i>hanging</i> punctuation mark is still enclosed inside its inline box
      and participates in text justification:
      its character advance width is just not measured when determining
      how much content fits on the line,
      how much the line's contents need to be expanded or compressed for justification,
      or how to position the content within the line box for text alignment.

    <p><dfn>Stops and commas</dfn> allowed to <i>hang</i> include:

Conformance Classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Text Level 3
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>

  <p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
  have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
  individual grammars of each property as given in this module.

  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by CSS Text Level 3 by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)

  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.

  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>

<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.

  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.

  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:

  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.

    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.

    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:

    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.

      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”).
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.

      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>

  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.

<h2 class="no-num" id="script-groups">Appendix E: Scripts and Spacing</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is informative (non-normative).</em></p>

  <p>Typographic behavior varies somewhat by language, but varies drastically
    by writing system. This appendix categorizes some common scripts in
    Unicode 6.0 according to their justification and spacing behavior. Category
    descriptions are descriptive, not prescriptive; the determining factor is
    the prioritization of <i>expansion opportunities</i>.

  <dl>
    <dt id="block-scripts"><dfn>block scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>CJK and by extension all Wide characters. (See [[!UAX11]])
        The following scripts are included:
        Bopomofo,
        Han,
        Hangul,
        Hiragana,
        Katakana,
        Yi
      </dd>
    <dt id="clustered-scripts"><dfn>clustered scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Scripts that have discrete units but do not use spaces between words,
        such as many Southeast Asian systems.
        The following scripts are included:
        Javanese,
        Khmer,
        Lao,
        Myanmar,
        Thai,
      <span class="issue">This list is likely incomplete. What else fits here?</span>
      </dd>
    <dt id="connected-scripts"><dfn>connected scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Devanagari, Ogham, and other scripts that use spaces between
        words and baseline connectors within words.
        By extension this category also includes any other Indic scripts
        whose typographic behavior is similar to Devanagari.
      The following scripts are included:
      Bengali,
      Brahmi,
      Devanagari,
      Gujarati,
      Gurmukhi,
      Kannada,
      Malayalam,
      Oriya?,
      Ogham,
      Tamil?,
      Telugu
      </dd>
    <dt id="cursive-scripts"><dfn>cursive scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Arabic and similar inherently cursive scripts.
      The following scripts are included:
      Arabic,
      Mongolian,
      N'Ko,
      Phags Pa,
      Syriac
      </dd>
    <dt id="discrete-scripts"><dfn>discrete scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Scripts that use spaces or visible word-separating
        punctuation between words and have discrete,
        unconnected (in print) units within words.
      The following scripts are included:
      Armenian,
      Bamum?,
      Braille,
      Canadian Aboriginal,
      Cherokee,
      Coptic,
      Cyrillic,
      Deseret,
      Ethiopic
      Greek,
      Hebrew,
      Kharoshthi,
      Latin,
      Lisu,
      Osmanya,
      Shavian,
      Tifinagh,
      Vai?
      </dd>
</dl>

<p>UAs should treat unrecognized scripts as <i>discrete</i>.

<p class="issue">This listing should ideally be exhaustive wrt Unicode.
Please <a href="#status">send</a> suggestions and corrections to the CSS
Working Group.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Guidelines for classification consider letter-spacing and justification:
  <ol>
    <li>If the script is cursive and may expand cursively but must not
      space between letters, it is <i>cursive</i>.
    <li>If the script primarily flexes word separators, it is either
      <i>discrete</i> or <i>connected</i>. <i>Discrete</i> scripts can
      space between letters. <i>Connected</i> scripts must not space
      between letters (typically because that would break the connections
      or otherwise look bad).
    <li>If the script primarily expands equally between its "letters"
      in native typesettings, it is either <i>block</i> or
      <i>clustered</i>. The exact classification depends on whether it
      always spaces when mixed with CJK and sometimes stays together
      when mixed with Thai and related scripts (<i>block</i>) or
      sometimes spaces when mixed with CJK and always spaces with Thai
      (<i>clustered</i>).
