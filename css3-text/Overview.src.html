<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

  <p>[document here]</p>

  <p class="issue">This draft describes features that are specific to certain scripts.
  There is an ongoing discussion about where these features belong: in
  existing CSS properties, in new CSS properties, or perhaps in other
  specifications.


<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>This module replaces and extends the text-level
  features defined in [[!CSS21]] chapter 16.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the
  definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.

<h3 id="terms">
Terminology</h3>

  <p id="grapheme-cluster">A <dfn>grapheme cluster</dfn> is what
    a language user considers to be a character or a basic unit of the
    script. The term is described in detail in the Unicode Technical
    Report: Text Boundaries [[!UAX29]]. This specification uses the
    <em>extended grapheme cluster</em> definition in [[!UAX29]] (not
    the <em>legacy grapheme cluster</em> definition). The UA may further
    tailor the definition as allowed by Unicode. Within this specification,
    the ambiguous term <dfn>character</dfn> is used as a friendlier synonym
    for <i>grapheme cluster</i>.
    See <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#character-properties">Characters and Properties</a>
    for how to determine the Unicode properties of a character.

  <p id="letter">A <dfn>letter</dfn> for the purpose of this specification
    is a <i>character</i> belonging to one of the Letter or Number general
    categories in Unicode. [[!UAX44]]

<h2 id="transforming">
  Transforming Text</h2>

  <h3 id="text-transform">
    <a name="caps-prop"></a>
    Transforming Text: the 'text-transform' property</h3>

    <table class="propdef">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Name:</th>
          <td><dfn>text-transform</dfn></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:
          <td>none |
            [ [ capitalize | uppercase | lowercase ] || full-width || full-size-kana ]
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Initial:</th>
          <td>none</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Applies to:</th>
          <td>all elements</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Inherited:</th>
          <td>yes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Percentages:</th>
          <td>N/A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Media:</th>
          <td>visual</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Computed&#160;value:</th>
          <td>as specified</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This property transforms text for styling purposes.
      Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>No effects.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:capitalize">''capitalize''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts the first <i>letter</i> of each word in titlecase; other characters
          are unaffected.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:uppercase">''uppercase''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in uppercase.
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:lowercase">''lowercase''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in lowercase.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:full-width">''full-width''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Puts all characters in fullwidth form.
          If the character does not have a corresponding fullwidth form,
          it is left as is.
          This value is typically used to typeset Latin characters and digits
          like ideographic characters.
      <dt><dfn title="text-transform:full-size-kana">''full-size-kana''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Converts all small Kana characters to normal Kana.
          This value is typically used for ruby annotation text,
          where all small Kana should be drawn as large Kana.
    </dl>

    <p>The case mapping rules for the character repertoire specified by the
      Unicode Standard can be found on the Unicode Consortium Web site
      [[!UNICODE]]. The UA must use the full case mappings for Unicode
      characters, including any conditional casing rules, as defined in
      Default Case Algorithm section. If (and only if) the content language
      of the element is, according to the rules of the document language,
      known, then any appropriate language-specific rules must be applied
      as well.
      These minimally include, but are not limited to, the language-specific
      rules in Unicode's
      <a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/SpecialCasing.txt">SpecialCasing.txt</a>.

    <div class="example">
      <p>For example, in Turkish there are two &ldquo;i&rdquo;s, one with
        a dot&mdash;&ldquo;İ&rdquo; and &ldquo;i&rdquo;&mdash; and one
        without&mdash;&ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;ı&rdquo;. Thus the usual
        case mappings between &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;i&rdquo; are
        replaced with a different set of mappings to their respective
        undotted/dotted counterparts, which do not exist in English. This
        mapping must only take effect if the language is known to be Turkish
        or Azeri; in other languages, the usual mapping of &ldquo;I&rdquo;
        and &ldquo;i&rdquo; is required. This rule is thus conditionally
        defined in Unicode's SpecialCasing.txt file.
    </div>

<!--
    <div class="example">
      <p>An example where the UA may choose to include rules beyond those
        in Unicode is Greek. In Greek, if the entire word is in upper case,
        accents are dropped or transformed
       http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/08/18/706383.aspx
    </div>
-->

    <p>The definition of "word" used for ''capitalize'' is UA-dependent;
      [[!UAX29]] is suggested (but not required) for determining such word
      boundaries. Authors should not expect ''capitalize'' to follow
      language-specific titlecasing conventions (such as skipping articles
      in English).

    <p>The definition of fullwidth and halfwidth forms can be found on the
      Unicode consortium web site at [[!UAX11]].
      The mapping to fullwidth form is defined by taking code points with
      the &lt;wide&gt; or the &lt;narrow&gt; tag in their Decomposition_Mapping
      in [[!UAX44]]. For the &lt;narrow&gt; tag, the mapping is from the code
      point to the decomposition (minus &lt;narrow&gt; tag), and for the
      &lt;wide&gt; tag, the mapping is from the decomposition (minus the
      &lt;wide&gt; tag) back to the original code point.</p>

    <p>The mappings for small Kana to normal Kana are defined in
      <a href="#small-kana">Small Kana Mappings</a>.</p>

    <p>When multiple values are specified and therefore multiple
      transformations need to be applied, they are applied in the following
      order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>''capitalize'', ''uppercase'', and ''lowercase''</li>
      <li>''full-width''</li>
      <li>''full-size-kana''</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Text transformation happens after <a href="#white-space-rules">white
      space processing</a>, which means that ''full-width'' transforms
      only preserved U+0020 spaces to U+3000.

    <div class="example">
      <p>The following example converts the ASCII characters in abbreviations
        in Japanese to their fullwidth variants so that they lay out and line
        break like ideographs:
      <pre>abbr:lang(ja) { text-transform: full-width; }</pre>
    </div>

    <p class="issue">CSS may introduce the ability to create custom mapping
      tables for less common text transforms, such as by an ''@text-transform''
      rule similar to ''@counter-style'' from [[CSS3LIST]], and this mechanism
      may be used to replace ''full-size-kana''.

<h2 id="white-space-processing">
  White Space Processing</h2>

  <p>The source text of a document often contains formatting that
    is not relevant to the final rendering: for example, breaking
    the source into segments (lines) for ease of editing or adding
    white space characters such as tabs and spaces to indent the
    source code. CSS white space processing allows the author to
    control interpretation of such formatting: to preserve or
    collapse it away when rendering the document. Note that white
    space processing in CSS interprets white space characters only
    for rendering: it has no effect on the underlying document data.

  <p id="segment-normalization">
    CSS does not define document segmentation rules. Segments could be
    separated by a particular newline seqence (such as a line feed or
    CRLF pair), or delimited by some other mechanism, such as the SGML
    RECORD-START and RECORD-END tokens.
    For CSS processing, each document-defined segment break, CRLF sequence
    (U+000D U+000A), carriage return (U+000D), and line feed (U+000A)
    in the text is treated as a segment break, which is then interpreted
    for rendering as defined below.

  <p class="note">Note that the document parser may have not only normalized
    segment breaks, but also collapsed other space characters or
    otherwise processed white space according to markup rules. Because CSS
    processing occurs <em>after</em> the parsing stage, it is not possible
    to restore these characters for styling. Therefore, some of the
    behavior specified below can be affected by these limitations and
    may be user agent dependent.</p>

  <p>Control characters (Unicode class Cc) other than tab (U+0009), line feed
    (U+000A), space (U+0020), and the bidi formatting characters (U+202<var>x</var>)
    are ignored for the purpose of rendering.

  <h3 id="white-space-collapsing">
    White Space Collapsing: the 'text-space-collapse' property</h3>

    <table class="propdef">
      <tbody>
        <tr>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This property declares whether and how
      <a href="#white-space-processing">white space</a> inside the element is
      collapsed. Values have the following meanings, which must be interpreted
      according to the <a href="#white-space-rules">white space processing
      rules</a>:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="white-space:collapse">''collapse''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>This value directs user agents to collapse sequences of white space
        into a single character (or <a href="#line-break-transform">in some
        cases</a>, no character).</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="white-space:preserve">''preserve''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>This value prevents user agents from collapsing sequences
      of white space. Segment breaks such as line feeds and carriage returns
      are preserved as forced line breaks.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="white-space:preserve-breaks">''preserve-breaks''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>This value collapses consecutive spaces, but renders segment
      breaks as forced line breaks.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>See <a href="#white-space-processing">White Space Processing Rules</a>
     for details on how white space collapses. An informative summary of
     ''collapse'' is presented below:
      <ul>
        <li>A sequence of segment breaks and other white space between two
          Chinese, Japanese, or Yi characters collapses into nothing.
        <li>A zero width space before or after a white space sequence
          containing a segment break causes the entire sequence of white space
          to collapse into a zero width space.
        <li>Otherwise, consecutive white space collapses into a single space.
      </ul>

    <p>This property determines the measure of the tab character (U+0009)
      when rendered. Integers represent the measure in space characters (U+0020).
      Negative integers are not allowed.

  <h3 id="white-space-rules">
    The White Space Processing Rules</h3>

    <p>White space processing affects only spaces (U+0020), tabs (U+0009),
      and <a href="#segment-normalization">segment breaks</a>.

    <p>For each inline (including anonymous inlines) within an inline
      formatting context, white space characters are handled as follows,
      ignoring bidi formatting characters as if they were not there:</p>

    <ul>
    <li id="collapse"><p>If 'text-space-collapse'
      is set to ''collapse'' or ''preserve-breaks'', white space characters
      are considered <dfn>collapsible</dfn> and are processed by
      performing the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>All spaces and tabs immediately preceding or following a segment
          break are removed.</li>
        <li>Segment breaks are transformed for
          rendering according to the <a href="#line-break-transform">line
          break transformation rules</a>.

          &mdash;even one outside the boundary of the inline containing
          the space, provided they are within the same inline formatting
          context&mdash;is removed.
          However, if removing this space would eliminate a line breaking

    <li><p>If 'text-space-collapse' is set to ''preserve'', any sequence of

      a line breaking opportunity exists at the end of the sequence.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then, the entire block is rendered. Inlines are laid out, taking bidi
      reordering into account, and wrapping as specified by the
      'text-wrap' property.</p>

    <p>As each line is laid out,</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A sequence of collapsible spaces at the beginning of a line is
        removed.
      <li>Each tab is rendered as a horizontal shift that lines up
        the start edge of the next glyph with the next tab stop.
        Tab stops occur at points that are multiples of the width of a
        space (U+0020) rendered in the block's font from the block's
        starting content edge. How many spaces is given by the 'tab-size'
        property.</li>
      <li>A sequence of collapsible spaces at the end of a line is removed.
      <li>If spaces or tabs at the end of a line are non-collapsible but
         have 'text-wrap' set to 'normal' or 'avoid' the UA may visually
         collapse their character advance widths.
    </ol>

    <p>White space that was not removed during the white space processing
      steps is called <dfn>preserved</dfn> white space.</p>

    <div class="example">
    <h4 id="egbidiwscollapse">
      Example of bidirectionality with white space collapsing</h4>

      <p>Consider the following markup fragment, taking special note of spaces
        (with varied backgrounds and borders for emphasis and identification):
        </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;ltr&gt;A<span class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span>&lt;rtl&gt;<span class="egbidiwsbB">&#160;</span>B<span class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>&lt;/rtl&gt;<span class="egbidiwsbC">&#160;</span>C&lt;/ltr&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>where the <code>&lt;ltr&gt;</code> element represents a left-to-right
        embedding and the <code>&lt;rtl&gt;</code> element represents a
        right-to-left embedding. If the 'text-space-collapse' property is set
        to ''collapse'', the above processing model would result in the
        following:</p>

      <ul style="line-height:1.3">
        <li>The space before the B (<span class="egbidiwsbB">&#160;</span>)
          would collapse with the space after the A (<span
          class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span>).</li>
        <li>The space before the C (<span class="egbidiwsbC">&#160;</span>)
          would collapse with the space after the B (<span
          class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This would leave two spaces, one after the A in the left-to-right
        embedding level, and one after the B in the right-to-left embedding
        level. This is then ordered according to the Unicode bidirectional
        algorithm, with the end result being:</p>

      <pre>A<span class="egbidiwsaA">&#160;</span><span class="egbidiwsaB">&#160;</span>BC</pre>

      <p>Note that there are two spaces between A and B, and none between B
        and C. This is best avoided by putting spaces outside the element
        instead of just inside the opening and closing tags and, where
        practical, by relying on implicit bidirectionality instead of explicit
        embedding levels.</p>
    </div>

    <h4 id="line-break-transform">
      Line Break Transformation Rules</h4>

      <p>When 'text-space-collapse' is ''preserve-breaks'', segment breaks are
      not <i>collapsible</i> and are transformed into a preserved line feed
      (U+000A).

      <p>When segment breaks are <i>collapsible</i>, they are
        either transformed into a space (U+0020) or removed depending on the
        context before and after the break.</p>

      <p class="note">Note that the white space processing rules have already
        removed any tabs and spaces after the segment break before these checks
        take place.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the character immediately before or immediately after the segment
          break is the zero-width space character (U+200B), then the break
          is removed, leaving behind the zero-width space.
        <li>Otherwise, if the East Asian Width property [[!UAX11]] of both
          the character before and after the line feed is F, W, or H (not A),
          and neither side is Hangul, then the segment break is removed.
        <li>Otherwise, the segment break is converted to a space (U+0020).
      </ul>

      <p class="issue">Comments on how well this would work in practice would
        be very much appreciated, particularly from people who work with
        Thai and similar scripts.</p>

<h2 id="line-breaking">
  Line Breaking and Word Boundaries</h2>

  <p>In most writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a line break occurs
    only at word boundaries. Many writing systems use spaces or
    punctuation to explicitly separate words, and line break opportunities
    can be identified by these characters. Scripts such as Thai, Lao, and
    Khmer, however, do not use spaces or punctuation to separate words.
    Although the zero width space (U+200B) can be used as an explicit word
    delimiter in these scripts, this practice is not common. As a result,
    a lexical resource is needed to correctly identify break points in such
    texts.

  <p>In several other writing systems, (including Chinese, Japanese, Yi,
    and sometimes also Korean) a line break opportunity is based on
    character boundaries, not word boundaries. In these systems a line can break
    anywhere <em>except</em> between certain character combinations.
    Additionally the level of strictness in these restrictions can vary
    with the typesetting style.</p>

  <p>CSS does not fully define where line breaking opportunities occur,
    however some controls are provided to distinguish common variations.
    For breaking opportunities created by characters that disappear at the
    line break (i.e. spaces), properties on the element containing that
    character control the line breaking at that opportunity.
    For breaking opportunities defined by the boundary between two characters,
    the properties on the element containing the boundary control breaking.
    <!-- http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2008Dec/0043.html -->
    For break opportunities given by the first or last character of a
    box, the break occurs immediately before/after the box rather than
    breaking the box.


  <div class="note">
    <p>Further information on line breaking conventions can be found in
      [[JLREQ]] and [[JIS4051]] for Japanese,
      [[ZHMARK]] for Chinese, and
      in [[!UAX14]] for all scripts in Unicode.
      <!-- The CSS Working Group notes that although UAX 14 contains a wealth of
      information about line breaking conventions, a literal implementation
      of its algorithm has been found to be inadequate in multiple situations. -->

    <p class="issue">Any guidance for appropriate references here would be
      much appreciated.
      <!-- Additionally, some guidance could be provided on how
      to break or not break Southeast Asian in the absence of a dictionary.
      (See e.g. <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Feb/0126.html">notes on Thai</a>.) -->
  </div>

  <p>Floated and absolutely-positioned elements do not introduce a line
    breaking opportunity. The line breaking behavior of a replaced element
    is equivalent to that of the Object Replacement Character (U+FFFC).

    <p>This property specifies the strictness of line-breaking rules applied

      punctuation. Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="line-break:auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>The UA determines the set of line-breaking restrictions to use,
        and it may vary the restrictions based on the length of the line; e.g., 
        use a less restrictive set of line-break rules for short lines.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="line-break:loose">''loose''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Breaks text using the least restrictive set of line-breaking

    <p>CSS distinguishes between three levels of strictness in the rules for
      implicit line breaking. The precise set of rules in effect for each
      level is up to the UA and should follow language conventions. However,
      this specification does recommend that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Following breaks be forbidden in ''strict'' line breaking and
        allowed in ''normal'' and ''loose'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before Japanese <a href="#small-kana">small kana</a>
          <li>breaks before the Katakana-Hiragana prolonged sound mark:
            &#x30FC;&nbsp;U+30FC
        </ul>
        If the language is known to be Chinese or Japanese, then additionally:
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before before hyphens:<br>
            &#x2010;&nbsp;U+2010,  &#x2013;&nbsp;U+2013,  &#x301C;&nbsp;U+301C,
            &#x30A0;&nbsp;U+30A0
        </ul>
      <li>Following breaks be forbidden in ''normal'' and ''strict'' line
        breaking and allowed in ''loose'':
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before iteration marks:<br>
            &#x3005;&nbsp;U+3005,  &#x303B;&nbsp;U+303B,  &#x309D;&nbsp;U+309D,

            &#x2025;&nbsp;U+2025,  &#x2026;&nbsp;U+2026
        </ul>
        If the language is known to be Chinese or Japanese, then additionally:
        <ul>
          <li>breaks before certain centered punctuation marks:<br>

        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">In CSS3 no distinction is made among the levels of
      strictness in non-CJK text: only CJK codepoints are affected, unless
      the text is marked as Chinese or Japanese, in which case some additional
      common codepoints are affected. However a future level of CSS may add
      behaviors affecting non-CJK text.

    <p>Support for this property is <em>optional</em>. It is recommended
      for UAs that wish to support CJK typography and strongly recommended
      for UAs in the Japanese market.</p>

    <p class="note">The CSSWG recognizes that in a future edition of the
      specification finer control over line breaking may be necessary to
      satisfy high-end publishing requirements.

<h2 id="hyphenation">Hyphenation</h2>

    <p>Hyphenation allows the controlled splitting of words to improve the
      layout of paragraphs. CSS Text Level 3 does not define the exact rules
      for hyphenation, however UAs are strongly encouraged to optimize their
      line-breaking implementation to choose good break points and
      appropriate hyphenation points.

    <p>Hyphenation is controlled with the 'hyphens' property.

    <p>Hyphenation opportunities are not considered when calculating
      ''min-content'' intrinsic sizes.

    <p>This property controls whether hyphenation is allowed to create more
      break opportunities within a line of text. Values have the following
      meanings:

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="hyphens:none">''none''</dfn>
        <dd>Words are not broken at line breaks, even if characters inside
          the word suggest line break points.
      <dt><dfn title="hyphens:manual">''manual''</dfn>
        <dd>Words are only broken at line breaks where there are characters
          inside the word that suggest line break opportunities. Characters
          can be explicit or conditional.
        <div class="example">
        <p>In Unicode, U+00AD is a conditional "soft hyphen" and U+2010 is an
          explicit hyphen. Unicode Standard Annex #14 describes the
          <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SoftHyphen">role of soft hyphens in</a>
          Unicode line breaking. [[!UAX14]]
          In HTML, &amp;shy; represents the soft hyphen character which
          suggests a hyphenation opportunity.
          <pre>ex&amp;shy;ample</pre>
        </div>
      <dt><dfn title="hyphens:auto">''auto''</dfn>
        <dd>Words can be broken at appropriate hyphenation points either as
          determined by hyphenation characters inside the word or as
          determined automatically by a language-appropriate hyphenation
          resource.
          Conditional hyphenation characters inside a word, if present,
          take priority over automatic resources when determining
          hyphenation points within the word.
    </dl>

    <p>Correct automatic hyphenation requires a hyphenation resource
      appropriate to the language of the text being broken. The UA is
      therefore only required to automatically hyphenate text for which
      the author has declared a language (e.g. via HTML <code>lang</code>
      or XML <code>xml:lang</code>) and for which it has an appropriate
      hyphenation resource.

    <p>When shaping scripts such as Arabic are allowed to break within words
      due to hyphenation, the characters must still be shaped as if the word
      were not broken.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>For example, if the word &ldquo;&#x0646;&#x0648;&#x0634;&#x062A;&#x0646;&#x0646;&rdquo;
      were hyphenated, it would appear as &ldquo;&#xFEE7;&#xFEEE;&#xFEB7;-&#xFE98;&#xFEE6;&rdquo;
      not as &ldquo;&#xFEE7;&#xFEEE;&#xFEB5;-&#xFE97;&#xFEE6;&rdquo;.

    <p>This property specifies the mode for text wrapping. Possible values:</p>

    <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="text-wrap:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lines may break at allowed break points, as determined by the
      line-breaking rules in effect. Line breaking behavior defined
      for the WJ, ZW, and GL line-breaking classes in
      [[!UAX14]] must be honored.
    <dt><dfn title="text-wrap:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Lines may not break; text that does not fit within the block container
      overflows it.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-wrap:avoid">''avoid''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Line breaking is suppressed within the element: the UA may only break
      within the element if there are no other valid break points in the
      line. If the text breaks, line-breaking restrictions are honored as for
      'normal'.
    </dl>

    <p>Regardless of the 'text-wrap' value, lines always break at forced breaks:
     for all values, line-breaking behavior defined for the BK, CR, LF, CM
     NL, and SG line breaking classes in [[!UAX14]] must
     be honored.</p>

    <p>When <span class="property">'text-wrap'</span> is set to 'normal' or
      'avoid', UAs that allow breaks at punctuation other than spaces
      should prioritize breakpoints.
      For example, if breaks after slashes have a lower priority than spaces,
      the sequence "check /etc" will never break between the '/' and the 'e'.
      The UA may use the width of the containing block, the text's language,
      and other factors in assigning priorities.
      As long as care is taken to avoid such awkward breaks, allowing breaks at
      appropriate punctuation other than spaces is recommended, as it results
      in more even-looking margins, particularly in narrow measures.</p>

    <!-- add a sample prioritization algorithm -->

<h4 id="example-avoid">

    <div class="example">

    <p>A block of text is a stack of

      In the case of 'start', 'end', 'left', 'right' and 'center', this

  <h4 id="character-alignment">Character-based Alignment in a Table Column</h4>
  
    <p>When multiple cells in a column have an <i>alignment character</i> specified,
      the alignment character of each such cell in the column is centered along
      a single column-parallel axis and the rest of the text in the column
      shifted accordingly. (Note that the strings do not have to be the same
      for each cell, although they usually are.)

    <p>A keyword value may be specified in conjunction with the &lt;string&gt;
      value; if it is not given, it defaults to ''right''. This value is used:
    <ul>
      <li>when character-based alignment is applied to boxes that are not table
        cells.
      <li>when the text wraps to multiple lines (at unforced break points).
      <li>when a character-aligned cell spans more than one column. In this
        case the keyword alignment value is used to determine which column's
        axis to align with: the leftmost column for ''left'', the rightmost
        column for ''right'' and ''center'', the startmost column for ''start'',
        the endmost column for ''end''.
      <li>when the column is wide enough that the character alignment alone does
        not determine the positions of its character-aligned contents. In this
        case the keyword alignment of the first cell in the column with a
        specified alignment character is used to slide the position of the
        character-aligned contents to match the keyword alignment insofar as
        possible without changing the width of the column.
        For ''center'', the UA may center
        the aligned contents using its extremes, center the alignment axis
        itself (insofar as possible), or optically center the aligned contents
        some other way (such as by taking a weighted average of the extent of
        the cells' contents to either side of the axis).
    </ul>

    <p class="note">Right alignment is used by default for character-based
      alignment because numbering systems are almost all left-to-right even
      in right-to-left writing systems, and the primary use case of
      character-based alignment is for numerical alignment.</p>

    <p>If the alignment character appears more than once in the text, the first
      instance is used for alignment. If the alignment character does not appear
      in a cell at all, the string is aligned as if the alignment character had
      been inserted at the end of its contents.

    <p>Character-based alignment occurs before table cell width computation so
      that auto width computations can leave enough space for alignment.
      Whether column-spanning cells participate in the alignment prior to
      or after width computation is undefined.
      If width constraints on the cell contents prevent full alignment
      throughout the column, the resulting alignment is undefined.

    <p>This property describes how the last line of a block or a line
      right before a forced line break is aligned. If a line is also
      the first line of the block or the first line after a forced line
      break, then 'text-align-last' takes precedence over 'text-align'
      <em>except</em> when two keywords are given for 'text-align'
      (i.e. when 'text-align' assigns an explicit first line alignment).
      
    <p>''auto'' is
      equivalent to the value of the 'text-align' property except when
      'text-align' is set to ''justify'', in which case it is ''justify''
      when 'text-justify' is ''distribute'' and ''start'' otherwise. 
      All other values have the same meanings as in 'text-align'.</p>

    <p>This property selects the justification method used when a line's
      alignment is set to ''justify'' (see 'text-align'), primarily by
      controlling which scripts' characters are adjusted together or
      separately.
      The property applies to block containers, but the UA may (but
      is not required to) also support it on inline elements.
      It takes the following values:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn title="text-justify:auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>The UA determines the justification algorithm to follow, based
          on a balance between performance and adequate presentation quality.
          <p class="note">One possible algorithm is to determine the behavior
          based on the language of the paragraph: the UA can then choose
          appropriate value for the language, like ''inter-ideograph''
          for CJK, or ''inter-word'' for English.
          Another possibility is to use a justification method that is a
          universal compromise for all scripts, e.g. the ''inter-cluster''
          method with block scripts raised to first priority.</p>

        <dd>Justification primarily stretches
          <a href="#cursive-scripts">cursive scripts</a> through the use of
          kashida or other calligraphic elongation.
          This value is <em>optional</em> for conformance to CSS3 Text.
          (UAs that do not support cursive elongation must
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-2010/#partial">treat the value
          as invalid</a>.)
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>When justifying text, the user agent takes the remaining space between
      the ends of a line's contents and the edges of its line box, and
      distributes that space throughout its contents so that the contents
      exactly fill the line box. If the 'letter-spacing' and 'word-spacing'
      property values allow it, the user agent may also distribute negative
      space, putting more content on the line than would otherwise fit under
      normal spacing conditions. The exact justification algorithm is
      UA-dependent; however, CSS provides some general guidelines which should
      be followed when any justification method other than 'auto' is
      specified.</p>

    <p id="expansion-opportunity">CSS defines <dfn>expansion opportunities</dfn>
      as points where the justification algorithm may alter spacing within
      the text. These expansion opportunities fall into priority
      levels as defined by the justification method. Within a line, expansion
      and compression should primarily target the first-priority expansion
      opportunities; lower priority expansion opportunities are adjusted at a
      lower priority as needed.

    <p>Expansion and compression limits are given by the
      <a href="#letter-spacing">letter-spacing</a>
      and <a href="#word-spacing">word-spacing</a> properties.
      How any remaining space is distributed once all expansion opportunities
      reach their limits is up to the UA. If the inline contents of a line
      cannot be stretched to the full width of the line box, then they must be
      aligned as specified by the 'text-align-last' property. (If
      'text-align-last' is ''justify'', then they must be aligned as for
      ''center'' if 'text-justify' is ''distribute'' and as ''start''
      otherwise.)</p>

    <p>The expansion opportunity priorities for values of 'text-justify'
      are given in the table below. Since justification behavior
      varies by writing system, expansion opportunities are organized by
      <a href="#script-groups">script categories</a>.
      An expansion opportunity exists between two <i>letters</i> at a
      priority level when at least one of them belongs to a script category
      at that level and the other does not belong to a higher priority level.
      All scripts in the same priority level must be treated exactly the same.
      Word separators (spaces) and other symbols and punctuation are treated
      specially, see below.

    <p id="auto-justify"><small>* The ''auto'' column defined above is informative; it
      suggests a prioritization that presents a universal compromise among
      justification methods.</small></p>
    <p id="justify-spaces">The <dfn title="spaces-category">spaces</dfn> category represents
      expansion opportunities at <a href="#word-separator">word separators</a>.
      (See <a href="#word-spacing">'word-spacing'</a>.) Except when
      'text-justify' is ''distribute'', the UA may treat
      spaces differently than other expansion points in the same priority,
      but must not change their priority with respect to expansion points
      in other priority levels. For example, in Japanese ''inter-ideograph''
      justification (which treats CJK characters at a higher priority than
      Latin characters), word spaces traditionally have a higher priority
      than inter-CJK spacing, and the UA may split the 1st-priority level
      to implement that. However the UA is not allowed to drop spaces to
      the same priority as Latin characters.
    <p id="justify-symbols">The <dfn id="punctuation-symbols">symbols</dfn>
      category represents the expansion opportunities existing at or between
      any pair of characters from the Unicode Symbols (S*) and Punctuation (P*)
      classes.
      The default justification priority of these points is given above.
      However, there may be additional rules controlling their justification
      behavior due to typographic tradition. Therefore, the UA may reassign
      specific characters or introduce additional levels of prioritization
      to handle expansion opportunities involving symbols and punctuation.
      For example, there are traditionally no expansion opportunities
      between consecutive EM DASH U+2014, HORIZONTAL BAR U+2015, HORIZONTAL
      ELLIPSIS U+2026, or TWO DOT LEADER U+2025 characters [[JLREQ]]; thus
      a UA might assign these characters to the "never" prioritization level.
      As another example, certain fullwidth punctuation characters are
      considered to contain an expansion opportunity (see 'text-spacing').
      The UA might therefore assign these characters to a higher prioritization
      level than the opportunities between ideographic characters.

    <p id="justify-cursive">For justification of <i>cursive scripts</i>,
      words may be expanded through kashida elongation or other cursive
      expansion processes. Kashida may be applied in discrete units or
      continuously, and the prioritization of kashida points is UA-dependent:
      for example, the UA may apply more at the end of the line. The
      UA should not apply kashida to fonts for which it is inappropriate.
      It may instead rely on other justification methods that lengthen
      or shorten Arabic segments (e.g. by substituting in swash forms or
      optional ligatures). Because elongation rules depend on the typeface
      style, the UA should rely on on the font whenever possible rather
      than inserting kashida based on a font-independent ruleset. The UA
      should limit elongation so that, e.g. in multi-script lines a short
      stretch of Arabic will not be forced to soak up too much of the
      extra space by itself. If the UA does not support cursive elongation,
      then, as with connected scripts, no expansion points exist between
      characters of these scripts.

    <p>The UA may enable or break optional ligatures or use other font
      features such as alternate glyphs or glyph compression to help
      justify the text under any method. This behavior is not controlled by
      this level of CSS.</p>

    <p class="issue">Add example of using 'text-justify' with the TeX
      algorithm.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>3.8 Line Adjustment in [[JLREQ]] gives an example of a set of rules for
        how a text formatter can justify Japanese text.
        It describes rules for cases where the 'text-justify' property is ''inter-ideograph''
        and the 'text-spacing' property does not specify ''no-compress''.</p>
      <p>It produces an effect similar to cases where
        the computed value of 'text-spacing' property does not specify
        ''trim-end'' or ''space-end''.
        If the UA wants to prohibit this behavior,
        rule b. of 3.8.3 should be omitted.</p>
      <p>Note that the rules described in the document specifically target Japanese.
        Therefore they may produce non-optimal results
        when used to justify other languages such as English.
        To make the rules more applicable to other scripts,
        the UA could, for instance,
        omit the rule to compress half-width spaces (rule a. of 3.8.3).</p>

  Spacing</h2>

  <p>CSS offers control over text spacing via the 'word-spacing'
  and 'letter-spacing' properties. While in CSS1 and CSS2 these could only
  be ''normal'' (justifiable) or a fixed length, CSS3 can indicate range
  constraints to control flexibility in justification.
  In addition the 'word-spacing' property can now be specified in
  percentages, making it possible to, for example, double or eliminate
  word spacing.

  <div class="example">
    <p>In the following example, word spacing is halved, but may expand up
    to its full amount if needed for text justification.
    <pre>p { word-spacing: -50% 0%; }</pre>
  </div>

  <p id="spacing-limit">The <dfn>&lt;spacing-limit&gt;</dfn> value type,
    which represents optimum, minimum, and maximum spacing in 'word-spacing'
    and 'letter-spacing', is defined as
  <pre class="prod"><dfn>&lt;spacing-limit></dfn> = [ normal | &lt;length&gt; | &lt;percentage&gt;]{1,3}</pre>

  <p>If three values are specified, they represent the optimum, minimum,
    and maximum in that order.
    If only two values are specified, then the first represents both the
    optimum and the minimum, and the second represents the maximum.
    If just one value is specified, then it represents the optimum,
    minimum, and maximum. The values are interpreted as defined below:

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="&lt;spacing-limit&gt;:normal">''normal''</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Specifies the normal optimum/minimum/maximum spacing, as defined
        by the current font and/or the user agent. See <a href="#normal-spacing">below</a>.
      </dd>
    <dt><dfn title="&lt;spacing-limit&gt;:&lt;length&gt;">''&lt;length&gt;''</dfn>
      <dd>Specifies extra spacing <em>in addition to</em> the normal optimum
        spacing.
        Values may be negative, but there may be implementation-dependent
        limits.
      </dd>
    <dt><dfn title="&lt;spacing-limit&gt;:&lt;percentage&gt;">''&lt;percentage&gt;''</dfn>
      <dd>Specifies the additional spacing as a percentage of the affected
        character.
        Only valid on 'word-spacing'. Negative values are not allowed.
      </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>In the absence of justification the optimum spacing is be used.
    The text justification process may alter the spacing
    from its optimum (see the <a href="#text-justify">'text-justify'</a>
    property, above) but must not violate the minimum spacing limit
    and should also avoid exceeding the maximum.

  <p>The minimum is treated as a hard constraint: if the maximum is less
    than the minimum, then the used it is set to the minimum. Likewise
    for the optimum. Similarly if the maximum is less than the optimum,
    then the used optimum is set to the used maximum.

   <p><dfn id="normal-spacing">Normal spacing</dfn>:
    Although ''normal'' spacing is UA-defined, the normal minimum and
    maximum must be defined relative to the optimum so that the minimum
    and maximum limits increase and decrease with changes to the optimum spacing.
    These limits may also vary according to some measure of the amount
    of text on a line (e.g. block width divided by font size), as
    larger measures can accommodate tighter spacing constraints.
    Normal optimum/minimum/maximum spacing may also vary based on the
    value of the <a href="#text-justify">'text-justify'</a> property,
    the element's language, and other factors.
    Normal spacing between a pair of
    <a href="#connected-scripts">connected</a> or
    <a href="#cursive-scripts">cursive</a>
    characters is always zero.

    <p>This property specifies the minimum, maximum, and optimal spacing
      between <i>characters</i>. Letter-spacing is applied in
      addition to any word-spacing. ''normal'' optimum letter-spacing is
      typically zero.</p>

    <p>Letter-spacing must not be applied at the beginning or at the end
       of a line. At element boundaries, the letter spacing is given by
       and rendered within the innermost element that <em>contains</em>
       the boundary.</p>

    <p>For the purpose of letter-spacing, each atomic inline (such as an
      image or inline block) is treated as a single <i>character</i>.

    <div class="example">
      <p>For example, given the markup</p>

      <pre>&lt;P&gt;a&lt;LS&gt;b&lt;Z&gt;cd&lt;/Z&gt;&lt;Y&gt;ef&lt;/Y&gt;&lt;/LS&gt;g&lt;/P&gt;</pre>

      <p>the spacing would be</p>

      <pre>a[0]b[1em]c[0.3em]d[1em]e[0.4em]f[0]g</pre>
    </div>

    <p>UAs may apply letter-spacing to cursive scripts. In this case, UAs
      should extend the space between disjoint characters as specified above
      <em>and</em> extend the visible connection between cursively connected
      characters by the same amount (rather than leaving a gap). The UA may
      use glyph substitution or other font capabilities to spread out the
      letters. If the UA  cannot expand a cursive script without breaking
      the cursive connections, it should not apply letter-spacing between
      characters of that script at all.</p>

    <p>When the resulting space between two characters is not the same as the
      default space, user agents should not use optional ligatures.</p>

    <p>This property specifies the indentation applied to lines of inline
      content in a block. The indent is treated as a margin applied to
      the start edge of the line box. Unless otherwise specified via the
      ''each-line'' and/or ''hanging'' keywords, only lines that are the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-line-pseudo">first
      formatted line</a> of an element are affected. For example, the first line of
      an anonymous block box is only affected if it is the first child
      of its parent element.

    <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>

    <p>This property determines whether a punctuation mark, if one is present,

    <p class="note">Note that if there is not sufficient padding on the

    </dl>

    <p>When a punctuation mark hangs, it is not considered when measuring
      the line's contents for fit, alignment, or justification.
      Depending on the line's alignment, this can push the mark outside the
      line box. At most one punctuation character may hang outside each edge
      of the line.

    <p class="note">A hanging punctuation mark is still enclosed inside
      its inline box and participates in text justification: its character
      advance width is just not measured when determining how much content
      fits on the line, how much the line's contents need to be expanded
      or compressed for justification, or how to position the content
      within the line box for text alignment.

    <p>Non-zero start and end borders or padding on an inline box are not
      allowed to hang. This can prevent a hangable punctuation mark
      from hanging: for example, a period at the end of an inline box with
      end padding cannot hang outside the end edge of a line.

    <p><dfn>Stops and commas</dfn> allowed to hang include:

      <p>The punctuation at the end of the first line for ''allow-end''
        does not hang, because it fits without hanging.
        However, if ''force-end'' is used, it is forced to hang.
        The justification measures the line without the hanging punctuation.

<h2 id="decoration">
  <a name="text-decoration">Text Decoration</a></h2>

  <h3 id="line-decoration">
    Line Decoration: Underline, Overline, and Strike-Through</h3>

    <p>The following properties describe line decorations that are added
      to the content of an element. When specified on or propagated to
      an inline box, such decoration affects all the boxes generated
      by that element, and is further propagated to any in-flow block-level
      boxes that split the inline
      (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level">CSS2.1 section 9.2.1.1</a>)
      When specified on or propagated to a ruby box, the decorations are
      further propagated only to the ruby base.
      When specified on or propagated to a a block container that establishes
      an inline formatting context, the decorations are propagated to an
      anonymous inline element that wraps all the in-flow inline-level children
      of the block container. For all other elements, the decorations are
      propagated to any in-flow children.
      
    <p class="note">Note that text decorations are not propagated to any
      out-of-flow descendants, nor to the contents of atomic inline-level
      descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.

    <p>By default underlines, overlines, and line-throughs are applied only
      to text (including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing):
      margins, borders, and padding are skipped. Elements containing
      no text, such as images, are likewise not decorated.
      The 'text-decoration-skip'
      property can be used to modify this behavior, for example allowing
      inline replaced elements to be underlined or requiring that white
      space be skipped.

    <p>In determining the position and thickness of text decoration lines,
      user agents may consider the font sizes and dominant baselines of
      descendants, but for a given element's decoration must use the same
      position and thickness throughout each line box. The
      <a href="#text-decoration-color">color</a> and
      <a href="#text-decoration-style">line style</a> of decorations must
      remain the same on all decorations applied by a given element, even
      if descendant elements have different color or line style values.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>The following figure shows the averaging for underline: 
      <p><img alt="In the first rendering of the underlined text '1st a'
                   with 'st' as a superscript, both the '1st' and the 'a'
                   are rendered in a small font. In the second rendering,
                   the 'a' is rendered in a larger font. In the third, both
                   '1st' and 'a' are large."
              height="105" src="underline-averaging.gif" width="326">
      <p>In the three fragments of underlined text, the underline is drawn
        consecutively lower and thicker as the ratio of large text to small
        text increases.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Relatively positioning a descendant moves all text decorations
      affecting it along with the descendant's text; it does not affect
      calculation of the decoration's initial position on that line.
      The 'visibility' property, filters, and other graphical transformations
      likewise affect text decorations as part of the text they're drawn on,
      even if the decorations were specified on an ancestor element.
      <span class="issue">Does this include 'text-shadow'? What about text-fill etc.?</span>

    <div class="example">

      <p>...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an
      anonymous inline element that surrounds the span element, causing 
      the text "Help, help!" to be blue, with the blue underlining from 
      the anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the 
      blockquote element. The <code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code> 
      in the em block is also underlined, as it is in an in-flow block to
      which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia,
      but the underline underneath it is still the blue underline from the
      anonymous inline element.</p>

        Omitted values are set to their initial values. A 'text-decoration'

          scripts such as Han or Tibetan, for which an alphabetic
          underline is too high: in such cases, aligning to the em box

          If the underline affects descendants with a lower content edge,
          the user agent should shift the underline down further to the
          lowest underlined content box edge.

          values given as lengths, percentages, ''top'', or ''bottom''
          when making this adjustment.

      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:triangle">''triangle''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display triangles as marks.
          The filled triangle is U+25B2 '&#x25b2;', and the open triangle is U+25B3 '&#x25b3;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:sesame">''sesame''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display sesames as marks.
          The filled sesame is U+FE45 '&#xfe45;', and the open sesame is U+FE46 '&#xfe46;'.</dd>
      <dt><dfn title="text-emphasis:sesame">''<var>&lt;string&gt;</var>''</dfn></dt>
        <dd>Display the given string as marks.
          Authors should not specify more than one <i>character</i> in &lt;string&gt;.
          The UA may truncate or ignore strings consisting of more than one grapheme cluster.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>If a shape keyword is specified but neither of ''filled'' nor ''open'' is
      specified, ''filled'' is assumed. If only ''filled'' or ''open'' is specified,
      the shape keyword computes to ''circle'' in horizontal writing mode and
      ''sesame'' in vertical writing mode.</p>

    <p>The marks should be drawn using the element's font settings with its
      size scaled down to 50%. However, not all fonts have all these glyphs,
      and some fonts use inappropriate sizes for emphasis marks in these
      code points. The UA may opt to use a font known to be good for
      emphasis marks, or the marks may instead be synthesized by the UA.
      Marks must remain upright in vertical typographic modes: like CJK
      characters, they do not rotate to match the writing mode.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p>One example of good fonts for emphasis marks is Adobe's opensource project,
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/adobe/kenten-generic/">Kenten Generic OpenType Font</a>,
        which is specially designed for the emphasis marks.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The marks are drawn once for each <i>character</i>. However,
      emphasis marks are not drawn for characters that are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#word-separator">Word separators</a> or that
        belong to the Unicode separator classes (Z*).
        (But note that emphasis marks <em>are</em> drawn for a space
         that combines with any combining characters.)</li>
      <li>Characters belonging to the Unicode classes for control codes
        and unassigned characters (Cc, Cf, Cn).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If emphasis marks are drawn for characters
      for which ruby is drawn in the same position as the emphasis mark,
      the ruby should be stacked between the emphasis marks and the base text.
      In this case, the position of the emphasis marks for a given element
      should be determined as if all characters have ruby boxes
      of the same height as the highest ruby box in the element.
      If the UA is not capable of drawing ruby and emphasis marks on the same side,
      the UA may hide ruby and draw only emphasis marks.</p>

    <p>This property accepts a comma-separated list of shadow effects to
      be applied to the text of the element. Values are interpreted as for
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-box-shadow">'box-shadow'</a>.
      [[!CSS3BACKGROUND]]
      The shadow is applied to all of the element's text as well as any
      text decorations it specifies.

    <p>The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is on
      top. The shadows may thus overlay each other, but they never overlay
      the text itself. The shadow must be painted at a stack level between
      the element's border and/or background, if present, and the elements
      text and text decoration. UAs should avoid painting text shadows over
      text in adjacent elements belonging to the same stack level and stacking
      context. (This may mean that the exact stack level of the shadows depends
      on whether the element has a border or background: the exact stacking
      behavior of text shadows is thus UA-defined.)</p>

    <p>Unlike 'box-shadow', text shadows are not clipped to the shadowed
      shape and may show through if the text is partially-transparent.
      Like 'box-shadow', text shadows do not influence layout, and do not
      trigger scrolling or increase the size of the scrollable area.

    <p class="note">The painting order of shadows defined here is the opposite
      of that defined in the 1998
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512">CSS2 Recommendation</a>.</p>

    <p>The ''text-shadow'' property applies to both the
      <code>::first-line</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>
      pseudo-elements.</p>

Conformance Classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Text Level 3
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>
  
  <p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
  have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
  individual grammars of each property as given in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by CSS Text Level 3 by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>
  
<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.
  
  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>
 
<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.
  
  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.
  
  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).

  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.

  <p>Major changes include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Change percentage values on 'word-spacing' to be absolute and to
      reference the affected glyph (rather than always the space character).
    <li>Dropped percentage values from 'letter-spacing'
    <li>Re-added ''last'' value to 'hanging-punctuation'; it has an effect on
      right-aligned text.
  </ul>

  <p>Significant details updated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined how 'letter-spacing' affects atomic inlines by treating them
      as a character.

<h2 class="no-num" id="script-groups">Appendix E: Scripts and Spacing</h2>

  <p><em>This appendix is informative (non-normative).</em></p>

  <p>Typographic behavior varies somewhat by language, but varies drastically
    by writing system. This appendix categorizes some common scripts in
    Unicode 6.0 according to their justification and spacing behavior. Category
    descriptions are descriptive, not prescriptive; the determining factor is
    the prioritization of <i>expansion opportunities</i>.

  <dl>
    <dt id="block-scripts"><dfn>block scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>CJK and by extension all Wide characters. (See [[!UAX11]])
        The following scripts are included:
        Bopomofo,
        Han,
        Hangul,
        Hiragana,
        Katakana,
        Yi
      </dd>
    <dt id="clustered-scripts"><dfn>clustered scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Scripts that have discrete units but do not use spaces between words,
        such as many Southeast Asian systems.
        The following scripts are included:
        Khmer,
        Lao,
        Myanmar,
        Thai,
      <span class="issue">This list is likely incomplete. What else fits here?</span>
      </dd>
    <dt id="connected-scripts"><dfn>connected scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Devanagari, Ogham, and other scripts that use spaces between
        words and baseline connectors within words.
        By extension this category also includes any other Indic scripts
        whose typographic behavior is similar to Devanagari.
      The following scripts are included:
      Bengali,
      Brahmi,
      Devanagari,
      Gujarati,
      Gurmukhi,
      Kannada,
      Malayalam,
      Oriya?,
      Ogham,
      Tamil?,
      Telugu
      </dd>
    <dt id="cursive-scripts"><dfn>cursive scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Arabic and similar inherently cursive scripts.
      The following scripts are included:
      Arabic,
      Mongolian,
      N'Ko?,
      Phags Pa?,
      Syriac
      </dd>
    <dt id="discrete-scripts"><dfn>discrete scripts</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Scripts that use spaces or visible word-separating
        punctuation between words and have discrete,
        unconnected (in print) units within words.
      The following scripts are included:
      Armenian,
      Bamum?,
      Braille,
      Canadian Aboriginal,
      Cherokee,
      Coptic,
      Cyrillic,
      Deseret,
      Ethiopic
      Greek,
      Hebrew,
      Kharoshthi,
      Latin,
      Lisu,
      Osmanya,
      Shavian,
      Tifinagh,
      Vai?
      </dd>
</dl>

<p>UAs should treat unrecognized scripts as <i>discrete</i>.

<p class="issue">This listing should ideally be exhaustive wrt Unicode.
Please <a href="#status">send</a> suggestions and corrections to the CSS
Working Group.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Guidelines for classification consider letter-spacing and justification:
  <ol>
    <li>If the script is cursive and may expand cursively but must not
      space between letters, it is <i>cursive</i>.
    <li>If the script primarily flexes word separators, it is either
      <i>discrete</i> or <i>connected</i>. <i>Discrete</i> scripts can
      space between letters. <i>Connected</i> scripts must not space
      between letters (typically because that would break the connections
      or otherwise look bad).
    <li>If the script primarily expands equally between its "letters"
      in native typesettings, it is either <i>block</i> or
      <i>clustered</i>. The exact classification depends on whether it
      always spaces when mixed with CJK and sometimes stays together
      when mixed with Thai and related scripts (<i>block</i>) or
      sometimes spaces when mixed with CJK and always spaces with Thai
      (<i>clustered</i>).
