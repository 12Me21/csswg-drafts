# Spatial Navigation
This is the repository for making the web excellently embrace the spatial navigation features so that the web technology can be propagated into several industries such as TV, IVI, game console, and upcoming smart devices.

This repository consists of the basic description for spatial navigation, landscapes of the relevant industries, and the current status for [W3C standardization](explainer.md) and [web engine implementation](impl.md) such as Blink, WebKit, Gecko, and EdgeHTML, while the relevant issues would be discussed in W3C working groups and web engine open source communities.

Raising some issues in this repository is always welcomed as well.

## Overview
**Spatial navigation** is the ability to navigate between focusable elements based on their position within a structured document. Spatial navigation is often called the directional navigation which enables four directional navigation. Users are usually familiar with the 2-way navigation using tab key for the forward direction and shift+tab key for the backward direction, but not familiar with the 4-way navigation using arrow keys.

Regarding TV remote control, game console pad, IVI jog dial with 4-way keys, and accessibility, spatial navigation has been a rising important input mechanism in several industries. If the web can embrace the spatial navigation and effectively support the functionalities in web engines and W3C APIs, it will be more promising technology for existing products as mentioned above and various upcoming products.

## FAQ
1. I’m not sure how the spatial navigation behavior work.
2. Isn’t it enough using the relevant web framework?
3. The spatial navigation seems not the general feature esp. in mobile with no physical key-based interface.
