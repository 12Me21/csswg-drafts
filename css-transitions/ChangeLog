2013-02-08  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Remove &nbsp; in "Applies to:" lies so the
  current version of the preprocessor puts them in the property table
  correctly.

- Another index improvement for transitionend
  event, and fix missed edit from adding pseudoElement.

- Avoid obsolete <a name=...> markup, and generate
  better index too.

2013-02-07  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Remove properties from the table that aren't in
  CSS21 or css3-color.

  This implements the remainder of this resolution at the Tucson face-
  to-face dated 2013-02-04 11:40:47 -0700 that goes in this spec
  (though many additions to other specs still need to be made), with
  the slight modification of not including the Level 2 properties
  dropped between 2.0 and 2.1 (which I was the one pushing for), since
  two of the relevant properties (font-stretch and font-size-adjust)
  have their animatability defined in the editor's draft of css3-fonts
  and the other one (marker-offset) was noted as questionable at the
  time of the resolution since the property may not be needed in the
  long term.

2013-02-05  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Make the 'shadow list' animation type handle all
  of the features in box-shadow rather than just the ones in text-
  shadow, incorporating rules already in css3-background, so that
  css3-background doesn't need to redefine it.

- Fix a few properties that were listed as
  animating percentage/calc but shouldn't be since percentages aren't
  part of their computed value space.

- Explain Animatable lines a bit better, and make
  the definitions in the property table look like Animatable lines
  should.

- Make interpolation of integers round to nearest
  rather than floor, and make interpolation of integers and font
  weights round the halfway points towards positive infinity, to match
  SMIL.

  As resolved at Tucson face-to-face, 2013-02-04 11:59:32 -0700.

  And with details of SMIL rounding behavior clarified in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/2013JanMar/0034.html

2013-02-04  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Add note explaining motivation for repeatable
  list concept, as requested during face-to-face meeting.

- Define repeatable list type, rename list to
  simple list and shadow to shadow list, and link property table to
  list types appropriately.

  Repeatable list is as resolved at Tucson face-to-face, 2013-02-04
  11:54:24 -0700.

- Add an id for animtype-list as well.

- Pull shorthand out of a list in which it doesn't
  really belong.

- Remove the transform list animation type, because
  it's defined and referenced entirely within the transforms
  specification.

  This is consistent with the resolution at Tucson face-to-face,
  2013-02-04 11:40:47 -0700.

- Make entries in property table hyperlinks to the
  animation types, as Animatable lines should be.

- Add ids to animation type definitions.

- Change TransitionEvent to use an event
  constructor.

  This edit is modeled on changeset
  217bbc27fc0f1ae88ab68cf7e1d7157d9e0cca28 [css3-animations].

  As resolved at Tucson face-to-face, 2013-02-04 11:35:49 -0700.

- Drop issue on potentially using a / in the
  transition shorthand, since it's no longer practical for
  compatibility reasons, and since there don't seem to be convincing
  reasons to do so.

  As resolved at Tucson face-to-face, 2013-02-04 11:34:52 -0700.

- Defer issue on keypath syntax to level 4.

  As resolved at Tucson face-to-face, 2013-02-04 11:32:35 -0700.

  [css3-animations][css3-transitions] Add warning about dynamic
  content causing seizures, with link to WCAG.

  Fixes: https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14669
  https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/actions/399 as resolved in:
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/0712.html

- Add issue for the one other not-yet-stable
  property that's listed in the property table.

- Update the property table to use the length,
  percentage, or calc animation type.

2013-02-03  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Describe the length, percentage, or calc
  interpolation type.

- Clean up excess code elements to make the
  formatting more consistent (and generated by the preprocessor).

- Fix incorrect use of single quotes in
  preprocessor input, which should only be used for CSS properties.

- Interpolation of colors is in premultiplied
  space.

  This is as resolved in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Nov/0262.html

- 'none', 'inherit', and 'initial' are not allowed
  within a length > 1 list of values of 'transition-property'

  This was resolved in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Nov/0262.html

- This todo note was completed by the paragraph
  preceding it.

2013-01-14  Tab Atkins  <jackalmage@gmail.com>

- markup tweak - quote all the id values, so ST2
  syntax highlighting works correctly.

- Fix outline-offset to transition as length.

2013-01-09 dino@apple.com
- Cleaned up timing function equivalence description ("1.0" -> "1")
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Dec/0274.html

2012-09-20  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Make single-* productions
  introduced earlier today have hyperlinks and better ids.

- Make it clear that the comma-
  separated items in the transition and animation shorthands don't
  themselves contain comma-separated items (which, if you read the
  grammar literally, they did). Fixes issue raised in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Sep/0375.html .

- Add Animatable and Canonical Order lines so the
  preprocessor will run again. I'm not sure why the preprocessor is
  making me put the Animatable lines before the Percentages lines
  (which is wrong). I'm also not sure the Canonical Order lines are
  right.

2012-07-12  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Add two more issues about types.

- Actually address the clamping issue.

- Move issue up to where it should be addressed.

- Say that future specifications may define additional types.

- Actually describe how the interpolation works.

2012-07-12  Sylvain Galineau  <sylvaing@microsoft.com>

- Make negative transition-duration and animation-duration values
  invalid (Bug 16806)

2012-05-11  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Make it more obvious in the <dl> that steps() and cubic-bezier() are
  functions. Editorial.

2012-04-20  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Mention that we're talking about computed values, per
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Apr/0564.html .

2012-04-04  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

- Added mising slash after this-version URL.

2012-04-03  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Update 'Previous Version' links to reflect today's publication as
  WD.

2012-03-29  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Make the new ids better by not starting them with 'the'.

- Fix a few more ids.

- Oops, I removed one of fantasai's changes that I should have left.

2012-03-29  fantasai  <fantasai.cvs@inkedblade.net>

- Use better IDs, but add a name for compatibility with old ones.

2012-03-29  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Reduce redirects found by the link checker.

- Fix markup validation errors and warnings.

- Add acknowledgments for edits over the previous few days (the edits
  from my February issues list).

- Even more pairs of [] are needed for the grammar to be correct.

  Thanks to Tab for pointing this out in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0679.html .

2012-03-28  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Fix two errors in the grammar of the steps() function: first, add
  necessary [] so that the comma applies to both the start and end
  values; second, add the ? that was intended to indicate the second
  parameter being optional.

- Add necessary []s to grammar: since juxtaposition binds tighter
  than |, [] are needed so that the comma needs to separate all the
  items in the list (rather than requiring a comma to separate values
  only for the first of the options).

- Working group is OK with names per today's teleconference. But also
  note issue about whether we should have initTransitionEvent at all.

- Switch font weight animation back to round-to-nearest, and note
  issues with rounding direction for both font weight and integer, per
  WG teleconference right now.

2012-03-27  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>

- Remove the two inclusions of shorthand properties that shouldn't
  have been included. (Editorial.)

- Add a pseudoElement attribute to transition events for the pseudo-
  element on which the transition happened.

  This is as raised in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Feb/1083.html and resolved in the 2012 March 7
  teleconference (minutes at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0195.html ).

  We probably still need to discuss the naming, and also whether there
  are any compatibility problems resulting from adding an argument to
  initTransitionEvent.

- Define rules for transitioning 'visibility' so that transitions
  where one of the values is 'collapse' have defined behavior.

  This is largely as proposed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public
  /www-style/2012Feb/1083.html and resolved in the 2012 March 7
  teleconference (minutes at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0195.html ).

  However, I realized we didn't discuss the issue of what happens when
  the result of the timing functions it outside of (0, 1). I
  addressed this as described in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public
  /www-style/2012Mar/0597.html

- Specify the rules for interpolating font-weight.

  This is roughly as proposed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public
  /www-style/2012Feb/1083.html and resolved in the 2012 March 7
  teleconference (minutes at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0195.html ).

  Except I noticed a mistake as described in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0596.html and
  fixed it by rounding down instead of rounding to nearest.

- Comment in 'crop' should mention css3-content.

- Better thought-through definition of the correct conditions on
  transition-duration and transition-delay for when there should be a
  transition.

- Define that transitions don't happen when duration and delay are
  both 0.

  This fixes https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=15838 as
  proposed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0013.html and resolved in the 2012 February 29
  teleconference (minutes at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0013.html ).

- 'vertical-align' keywords aren't animatable because nobody knows how
  the animation is supposed to work.

  This resolves https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14988
  as proposed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0013.html and resolved in the 2012 February 29
  teleconference (minutes at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0013.html ).

  Remove mention of 'grid-*' and 'zoom' properties.

  (The 'grid-*' properties are behind this spec and it's not clear how
  they animate. The 'zoom' property is non-standard.)

  This resolves https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14618
  and https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14626 as proposed
  in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0013.html
  and resolved in the 2012 February 29 teleconference (minutes at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0013.html ).

- Improve the example for how to specify styles for different
  forward/reverse behavior.

  This addresses https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14611
  without any technical fixes as proposed in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0013.html and
  resolved in the 2012 February 29 teleconference (minutes at
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0013.html ).

- Describe repeating/truncation behavior for uneven length lists,
  using rules where transition-property is the important length.

  This resolves https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=14604
  as proposed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0013.html and resolved in the 2012 February 29
  teleconference (minutes at http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0013.html ).

  and using the accent (in prose, not code, of course).

- Fix wording issue in previous commit pointed out in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Feb/0799.html .

- Allow 'all' within the list in transition-property, as resolved in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Nov/0709.html .

2009-11-17 dino@apple.com

- added rules for reversibility of transforms

2009-11-01 dino@apple.com

- made it clear that shorthand accepts duration before delay
  but also noted the request for 1s/2s type syntax
- space-separated lists of animatable property values are only
  interpolated if the lists have the same number of elements
- noted that the TransitionEvent is for notification, and thus
  has no default action (ie. cancelling the event doesn't really
  do anything)
- added elapsedTime to the context info of the TransitionEvent
- made it clear that transition events do not fire if the transition
  is cancelled (say if the transition-property is changed)
- described that shorthand properties can be animated
- referenced the SVG specification for the list of SVG properties that
  can be animated
- changed transition properties from "visual" media to "interactive",
  which means they do not apply to print
- noted that lists in transition properties repeat as a whole in order
  to provide necessary values
- added apostrophes into the property definitions (as reported by Øyvind)
- noted that shadow lists only interpolate when there are the same number
  of elements in the list
- Changes properties applying to "block-level and inline-level elements" to
  "all elements".
- Transitions also apply to :before and :after pseudo elements
