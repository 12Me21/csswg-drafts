Summary:  Unclear text about corner transitions in 5.4
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0258.html
Response: [to be sent by Elika]
Proposal: (From Elika and Bert:) "Otherwise, the center
	  of color and style transitions
	  between adjoining borders must a point along the curve 
	  that is a continuous monotonic function of the ratio of 
	  the border widths. However it is not defined what these 
	  transitions look like or what function maps from this 
	  ratio to a point on the curve."

Summary:  Unclear what border style is used on table cells, when
	  'border-image-source' doesn't apply

Summary:  How exactly does border-image apply to table elements with
	  collapsing borders (border conflict resolution)?
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0109.html
Response: [to be sent by Elika, with the edit already made and the
	  two options below]
Proposal: Two options: draw the table borders with invisible ink and
	  then draw the image on top of it; or an image border overrides
	  any other border in the conflict resolution. The difference
	  is the calculation of the width of each cell.
Editing status: Elika added "otherwise the element's borders
	  are invisble and the border image is drawn". Otherwise waiting
	  for the resolution of the two options above.

Issue 23

Issue 25
Summary:  Allow colors (esp. semi-transparent ones) on all background layers.
	  Tab says (1st response) it's no longer needed, because you
	  can soon use 'image(red)' anywhere a URL is allowed, and (2nd
	  response) that it would throw off the layer counting for the
	  'background-color' property.
