Summary:  'Border-image' syntax allows odd trailing slash.

	  two slashes in a row.

Edit: 	  Edited as above
Edit:	  2nd Proposal: Accept proposal from Kenny:
	  “All properties in Chapter 3 apply
	  to ::first-line and ::first-letter. All properties in
	  Chapter 4 apply to ::first-letter.”

Summary:  Unclear what border style is used on table cells, when
	  'border-image-source' doesn't apply
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0109.html
Response: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0602.html
Closed:   Accepted
Edit: 	  Added “(or doesn't apply)” after “cannot be displayed”; and added

Issue:    22
Summary:  How exactly does border-image apply to table elements with
	  collapsing borders (border conflict resolution)?
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0109.html
Response: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0602.html
Edit: 	  Added “otherwise the element's borders are
	  invisble and the border image is drawn”.
Edit:	  Proposal for the rest has two options:
	  (A) draw the table borders with invisible
	  ink and then draw the image on top of it; or (B) an image border
	  overrides any other border in the conflict resolution. (The
	  difference is the calculation of the width of each cell.)

Issue 23

	  border model, drawn the same as 'ridge'.”)

Issue 24
Summary:  Line thickness in 4.3 uses ambiguous words “may not”
	  (“may not be negative”). Should say: “are not allowed.”
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0103.html

Edit: 	  Edited

Issue 25
Summary:  Allow colors (esp. semi-transparent ones) on all background layers.
	  Tab says (1st response) it's no longer needed, because you
	  can soon use 'image(red)' anywhere a URL is allowed, and (2nd
	  response) that it would throw off the layer counting for the
	  'background-color' property.
