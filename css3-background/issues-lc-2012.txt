From:     Christoph Päper

From:     Christoph Päper
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0324.html

From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu
Comment:  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0109.html

	  way anyway), editors decide

Issue 24
Summary:  Line thickness in 4.3 uses ambiguous words “may not”
	  (“may not be negative”)
From:     Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu

Proposal: Change to “must not” or “is illegal”

Issue 25
Summary:  Allow colors (esp. semi-transparent ones) on all background layers.
	  Tab says (1st response) it's no longer needed, because you
	  can soon use 'image(red)' anywhere a URL is allowed, and (2nd
	  response) that it would throw off the layer counting for the
	  'background-color' property.
