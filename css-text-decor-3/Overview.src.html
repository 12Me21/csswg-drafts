Table of Contents</h2>

<!--toc-->

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This subsection is non-normative.</em>

  <p>This module covers text decoration, i.e. decorating the glyphs
  of the text once typeset according to font and typographic rules.
  (See [[CSS3TEXT]] and [[CSS3-FONTS]].)
  Such features are traditionally used not only for purely decorative purposes,
  but also in some cases to show emphasis, for honorifics,
  and to indicate editorial changes such as insertions, deletions, and misspellings.

  <p>CSS Levels 1 and 2 only defined very basic <a href="#line-decoration">line decorations</a>
  (underlines, overlines, and strike-throughs)
  appropriate to Western typographical traditions.
  Level 3 of this module adds the ability to change
  the color, style, position, and continuity of these decorations,
  and also introduces 
  <a href="#emphasis-marks">emphasis marks</a> (traditionally used in East Asian typography),
  and <a href="#text-shadow-property">shadows</a> (which were proposed then deferred from Level 2).

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>This module replaces and extends the text-decorating
  features defined in [[!CSS21]] chapter 16.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the
  definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>

  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.

<h3 id="terms">Terminology</h3>

  <p>The terms <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#grapheme-cluster"><dfn>character</dfn></a>,
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#letter"><dfn>letter</dfn></a>, and
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#content-language"><dfn>content language</dfn></a>
    as used in this specification are defined in [[!CSS3TEXT]].
    Other terminology and concepts used in this specification are defined
    in [[!CSS21]] and [[!CSS3-WRITING-MODES]].

<h2 id="line-decoration">
Line Decoration: Underline, Overline, and Strike-Through</h2>

  <p>
    The following properties describe line decorations that are added to the content of an element. 
    When specified on or propagated to an inline box, 
    that box becomes a <dfn>decorating box</dfn> for that decoration,
    applying the decoration to all its fragments.
    The decoration is then further propagated to any in-flow block-level boxes that split the inline
    (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#anonymous-block-level">CSS2.1 section 9.2.1.1</a>).
    When specified on or propagated to a block container that establishes an inline formatting context, 
    the decorations are propagated to an anonymous inline box that wraps all the in-flow inline-level children of the block container. 
    When specified on or propagated to a ruby box, 
    the decorations are propagated only to the ruby base.
    For all other box types, 
    the decorations are propagated to all in-flow children.

  <p class="note">
    Note that text decorations are not propagated to any out-of-flow descendants, 
    nor to the contents of atomic inline-level descendants such as inline blocks and inline tables.
    They are also not propagated to inline children of inline boxes,
    although the decoration is <em>applied</em> to such boxes.

  <p>
    By default underlines, overlines, and line-throughs are applied only to non-replaced inline boxes,
    and are drawn over all text (including white space, letter spacing, and word spacing).
    Atomic inlines, such as images, are not decorated.
    The 'text-decoration-skip' property can be used to modify this behavior, 
    for example allowing atomic inlines to be underlined 
    or requiring that white space be skipped.
    Margins, borders, and padding of the <i>decorating box</i> are always skipped. 

  <p>Relatively positioning a descendant moves all text decorations
    applied to it along with the descendant's text; it does not affect
    calculation of the decoration's initial position on that line.
    The 'visibility' property, 'text-shadow', filters, and other graphical transformations
    likewise affect text decorations as part of the text they're drawn on,
    even if the decorations were specified on an ancestor box.

  <div class="example">
    <p>In the following style sheet and document fragment:</p>
    <pre>
<!-- -->   blockquote { text-decoration: underline; color: blue; }
<!-- -->   em { display: block; }
<!-- -->   cite { color: fuchsia; }</pre>
    <pre>
<!-- -->   &lt;blockquote&gt;
<!-- -->    &lt;p&gt;
<!-- -->     &lt;span&gt;
<!-- -->      Help, help!
<!-- -->      &lt;em&gt; I am under a hat! &lt;/em&gt;
<!-- -->
<!-- -->      &lt;cite&gt; &mdash;GwieF &lt;/cite&gt;
<!-- -->     &lt;/span&gt;
<!-- -->    &lt;/p&gt;
<!-- -->   &lt;/blockquote&gt;</pre>
    <p>...the underlining for the blockquote element is propagated to an
    anonymous inline box that surrounds the span element, causing
    the text "Help, help!" to be blue, with the blue underlining from
    the anonymous inline underneath it, the color being taken from the
    blockquote element. The <code>&lt;em&gt;text&lt;/em&gt;</code>
    in the em block is also underlined, as it is in an in-flow block to
    which the underline is propagated. The final line of text is fuchsia,
    but the underline underneath it is still the blue underline from the
    anonymous inline element.</p>
    <p><img src="underline-example.png" alt="Sample rendering of the above underline example"></p>
    <p>This diagram shows the boxes involved in the example above. The
    rounded aqua line represents the anonymous inline element wrapping
    the inline contents of the paragraph element, the rounded blue line
    represents the span element, and the orange lines represent the
    blocks.</p>

    Values have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-line:none">''none''</dfn>
      <dd>Neither produces nor inhibits text decoration.
    <dt><dfn>''underline''</dfn>

    <dt><dfn>''line-through''</dfn>
      <dd>Each line of text has a line through the middle.
    <dt><dfn>''blink''</dfn>
      <dd>
        The text blinks (alternates between visible and invisible).
        Conforming user agents may simply not blink the text. 
        Note that not blinking the text is one technique to satisfy <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG/guidelines.html#tech-on-off-blinking-text">checkpoint 3.3 of WAI-UAAG</a>.
        This value is <strong>deprecated</strong> in favor of Animations [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]].

<h3 id="text-decoration-color-property">
Text Decoration Color: the 'text-decoration-color' property</h3>

  <p>This property specifies the color of text decoration (underlines
    overlines, and line-throughs) set on the element with
    'text-decoration-line'.</p>

  <p>
    The color of text decorations must remain the same on all decorations originating from a given element,
    even if descendant boxes have different specified colors.

<h3 id="text-decoration-style-property">
Text Decoration Style: the 'text-decoration-style' property</h3>

  <p>This property specifies the style of the line(s) drawn for
    text decoration specified on the element. Values have the
    same meaning as for the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-border-style">border-style
    properties</a> [[!CSS3BG]]. ''wavy'' indicates a wavy line.</p>

  <p>
    The style of text decorations must remain the same on all decorations originating from a given element,
    even if descendant boxes have different specified styles.

    <tr>
      <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:

      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <th>Computed&#160;value:
      <td>as specified
  </table>

  <p>This property is a shorthand for setting 'text-decoration-line',
    'text-decoration-color', and 'text-decoration-style' in one declaration.
    Omitted values are set to their initial values. A 'text-decoration'
    declaration that omits both the 'text-decoration-color'
    and 'text-decoration-style' values is backwards-compatible
    with CSS Levels 1 and 2.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <p>The following example underlines unvisited links with a solid blue
    underline in CSS1 and CSS2 UAs and a navy dotted underline in CSS3 UAs.</p>

    <pre><code class="css">
<!-- -->:link {

  <p>This property specifies what parts of the element's content
    any text decoration affecting the element must skip over. It
    controls all text decoration lines drawn by the element
    and also any text decoration lines drawn by its ancestors.
    Values have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-skip:none">''none''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Skip nothing: text-decoration is drawn for all text content
      and for inline replaced elements.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-skip:objects">''objects''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Skip this element if it is an atomic inline (such as an
      image or inline-block).</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-skip:spaces">''spaces''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Skip white space: this includes regular spaces (U+0020) and
      tabs (U+0009), as well as nbsp (U+00A0), ideographic space
      (U+3000), all fixed width spaces (such as U+2000&ndash;U+200A,
      U+202F and U+205F), and any adjacent letter-spacing or
      word-spacing.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-skip:ink">''ink''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>Skip over where glyphs are drawn: interrupt the decoration
      line to let text show through where the text decoration would
      otherwise cross over a glyph. The UA may also skip a small
      distance to either side of the glyph outline.</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-skip:edges">''edges''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The UA should place the start and end of the line inwards from
      the content edge of the <i>decorating element</i> so that, e.g. two
      underlined elements side-by-side do not appear to have a single
      underline. (This is important in Chinese, where underlining is a
      form of punctuation.)</dd>
    <dt><dfn title="text-decoration-skip:box-decoration">''box-decoration''</dfn>
    <dd>
      Skip over the box's margin, border, and padding areas.
      Note that this only has an effect on decorations imposed by an ancestor.
  </dl>

  <p class="note">Note that this property inherits and that descendant
    elements can have a different setting.</p>

  <p class='note'>
    Note that CSS 2.1 required skipping margins, borders, and padding always.
    In this level, by default only the margins, borders, and padding of the <i>decorating element</i> are skipped.

  <p>This property sets the position of an underline specified
    on the same element: it does not affect underlines specified by
    ancestor elements. Values have the following meanings:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn id="underline-auto" title="text-underline-position: auto">''auto''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The user agent may use any algorithm to determine the
      underline's position; however it must be placed at or under
      the alphabetic baseline.
      <p class="note">It is suggested that the underline position
      be ''alphabetic'' unless it crosses either subscripted (or
      otherwise lowered) text, or it affects characters from Asian
      scripts such as Han or Tibetan, for which an alphabetic
      underline is too high: in such cases, aligning to the em box
      edge as described for ''under left'' is more appropriate.
    <dt><dfn id="underline-alphabetic" title="text-underline-position: alphabetic">''alphabetic''</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The underline is positioned relative to the alphabetic baseline. In
      this case the underline is likely to cross some descenders.

    <dd>In horizontal writing modes, the underline is positioned
      relative to the under edge of the element's content box.
      In this case the underline usually does not cross the descenders.
      (This is sometimes called "accounting" underline.)
      If the underline affects descendants with a lower content edge,
      the user agent should shift the underline down further to the
      lowest underlined content box edge.
      The user agent may ignore elements with ''vertical-align''
      values given as lengths, percentages, ''top'', or ''bottom''
      when making this adjustment.
      (Note that images that are not affected by the underline per
      'text-decoration-skip' will not affect the position of the
      underline.)

        <p>Because 'text-underline-position' inherits, and is not reset
          by the 'text-decoration' shorthand, the following example
          switches the document to use ''under'' underlining, which can
          be more appropriate for writing systems  with long, complicated
          descenders. It is also often useful for mathematical or chemical
          texts that use many subscripts.

    <dd>In vertical writing modes, the underline is aligned as for
      ''under'', except it is always aligned to the left edge of the text.
      If this causes the underline to be drawn on the "over" side of
      the text, then an overline also switches sides and is drawn on
      the "under" side.

Determining the Position and Thickness of Line Decorations</h3>

  <p>In determining the position of text decoration lines,
    user agents must consider, per line box, the "ideal" positions of all fragments
    of in-flow inline descendants of the <i>decorating box</i> on that line
    as follows
    (treating <a href="#underline-left"><i>over</i>-positioned underlines</a> as <i>over</i> lines
    and <a href="#underline-left"><i>under</i>-positioned overlines</a> as <i>under</i> lines):

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#over"><i>over</i></a> lines
    <dd>
      Align the line decoration with respect to the highest
      <!-- <i>text-over</i> baseline of the considered fragments. -->
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#over"><i>over</i></a> edge
      of the considered fragments' EM boxes.

    <dt><a href="#underline-alphabetic"><i>alphabetic</i></a> underlines
    <dd>
      Calculate an average of the ideal underlining offsets
      (from their respective alphabetic baselines)
      of the considered fragments,
      assigning any inline with non-initial 'vertical-align' the ideal offset of its parent.
      Align the line decoration to the lowest alphabetic baseline considered,
      with that calculated offset.
      (Alphabetic baselines can differ between ''baseline''-aligned boxes if the dominant baseline is non-alphabetic.)

    <dt>non-alphabetic <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#under"><i>under</i></a> lines
    <dd>
      Position the line decoration with respect to the lowest
      <!-- <i>text-under</i> baseline of the considered fragments. -->
      <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/#under"><i>under</i></a> edge
      of the considered fragments' EM boxes.

    <dt>line-throughs
    <dd>
      For each set of considered fragments with the same 'font-size', 
      compute an ideal position averaged from their direct contents and font metrics,
      assigning any fragment with non-initial 'vertical-align' the ideal position of its parent.
      Position the portion of the line across each decorated fragment at that fragment's ideal position.
      (Essentially, this performs the same sort of averaging as for alphabetic underlines,
      but recomputes the position when drawing across a descendant with a different computed 'font-size'.
      This ensures that the text remains effectively "crossed out" despite any font size changes.)
  </dl>

  <p>
    CSS does not define the thickness of line decorations.
    In determining the thickness of text decoration lines,
    user agents may consider the font sizes, faces, and weights of descendants
    to provide an appropriately averaged thickness.

  <div class="example">
    <p>The following figure shows the averaging for underline:
    <p><img alt="In the first rendering of the underlined text '1st a'
                 with 'st' as a superscript, both the '1st' and the 'a'
                 are rendered in a small font. In the second rendering,
                 the 'a' is rendered in a larger font. In the third, both
                 '1st' and 'a' are large."
            height="105" src="underline-averaging.gif" width="326">
    <p>In the three fragments of underlined text, the underline is drawn
      consecutively lower and thicker as the ratio of large text to small
      text increases.</p>
    <p>Using the same example, a line-through would in the second fragment,
    instead of averaging the two font sizes,
    split the line-through into two segments:
    <p><img alt="" src="linethrough-averaging.gif">
    <p>In both cases, however, the superscript, due to the vertical-alignment shift,
    has no effect on the position of the line.
  </div>

  <div class="note">
    <p>In some cases (such as in OpenType) the font format can offer
      information about the appropriate position of an underline.
      Typically this information gives the position of an ''alphabetic''
      underline; in some cases (especially in CJK fonts), it gives
      the position of a ''under left'' underline. (In this case,
      the font's underline metrics typically touch the bottom edge
      of the em box).
      The UA is encouraged to use information (such as the underline
      thickness, or appropriate alphabetic alignment) from the font
      wherever appropriate.

  <p>This property applies emphasis marks to the element's text.
    Values have the following meanings:</p>

      <dd>Display the given string as marks.
        Authors should not specify more than one <i>character</i> in &lt;string&gt;.
        The UA may truncate or ignore strings consisting of more than one grapheme cluster.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>If a shape keyword is specified but neither of ''filled'' nor ''open'' is
    specified, ''filled'' is assumed. If only ''filled'' or ''open'' is specified,
    the shape keyword computes to ''circle'' in horizontal writing mode and
    ''sesame'' in vertical writing mode.</p>

  <p>The marks should be drawn using the element's font settings with its
    size scaled down to 50%. However, not all fonts have all these glyphs,
    and some fonts use inappropriate sizes for emphasis marks in these
    code points. The UA may opt to use a font known to be good for
    emphasis marks, or the marks may instead be synthesized by the UA.
    Marks must remain upright in vertical writing modes: like CJK
    characters, they do not rotate to match the writing mode.</p>

  <p class="note">
      One example of good fonts for emphasis marks is Adobe's opensource project,
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/adobe/kenten-generic/">Kenten Generic OpenType Font</a>,
      which is specially designed for the emphasis marks.
  </p>

  <p>The marks are drawn once for each <i>character</i>. However,
    emphasis marks are not drawn for characters that are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#word-separator">Word separators</a> or that
      belong to the Unicode separator classes (Z*).
      (But note that emphasis marks <em>are</em> drawn for a space
       that combines with any combining characters.)</li>
    <li>Characters belonging to the Unicode classes for control codes
      and unassigned characters (Cc, Cf, Cn).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If emphasis marks are drawn for characters
    for which ruby is drawn in the same position as the emphasis mark,
    the ruby should be stacked between the emphasis marks and the base text.
    In this case, the position of the emphasis marks for a given element
    should be determined as if all characters have ruby boxes
    of the same height as the highest ruby box in the element.
    If the UA is not capable of drawing ruby and emphasis marks on the same side,
    the UA may hide ruby and draw only emphasis marks.</p>

    <p class="caption">Emphasis marks applied to 4 characters, and ruby to 2 of them</p>

  <p class="note">A future level of CSS may define controls to specify
    what to do when emphasis marks and ruby text coincide.</p>

  <p>This property accepts a comma-separated list of shadow effects to
    be applied to the text of the element. Values are interpreted as for
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#the-box-shadow">'box-shadow'</a>
    [[!CSS3BG]]. (But note that spread values are not allowed.)
    The shadow is applied to all of the element's text as well as any
    text decorations it specifies.

  <p>The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is on
    top. The shadows may thus overlay each other, but they never overlay
    the text itself. The shadow must be painted at a stack level between
    the element's border and/or background, if present, and the elements
    text and text decoration. UAs should avoid painting text shadows over
    text in adjacent elements belonging to the same stack level and stacking
    context. (This may mean that the exact stack level of the shadows depends
    on whether the element has a border or background: the exact stacking
    behavior of text shadows is thus UA-defined.)</p>

  <p>Unlike 'box-shadow', text shadows are not clipped to the shadowed
    shape and may show through if the text is partially-transparent.
    Like 'box-shadow', text shadows do not influence layout, and do not
    trigger scrolling or increase the size of the scrollable area.

  <p class="note">The painting order of shadows defined here is the opposite
    of that defined in the 1998
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512">CSS2 Recommendation</a>.</p>

  <p>The ''text-shadow'' property applies to both the
    <code>::first-line</code> and <code>::first-letter</code>
    pseudo-elements.</p>

Conformance</h2>

<h3 id="conventions">
Document Conventions</h3>

  <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
  descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words “MUST”,
  “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”,
  “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in the normative parts of this
  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
  However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
  letters in this specification.

  <p>All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
  explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>

  <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words “for example”
  or are set apart from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>,
  like this:

  <div class="example">
    <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Informative notes begin with the word “Note” and are set apart from the
  normative text with <code>class="note"</code>, like this:

  <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>

<h3 id="conformance-classes">
Conformance Classes</h3>

  <p>Conformance to CSS Text Level 3
  is defined for three conformance classes:
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS
      style sheet</a>.
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders
      documents that use them.
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a>
      that writes a style sheet.
  </dl>

  <p>A style sheet is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if all of its declarations that use properties defined in this module
  have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
  individual grammars of each property as given in this module.

  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the features defined
  by CSS Text Level 3 by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)

  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Text Level 3
  if it writes style sheets that are syntactically correct according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each feature in
  this module, and meet all other conformance requirements of style sheets
  as described in this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification
  reserves a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.

  <p>Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage
  in the W3C process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered
  experimental. The CSS Working Group recommends that implementations
  use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such features, including those in
  W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with future changes
  in the draft.
  </p>

<h3 id="testing">Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage,
  non-experimental implementations are possible, and implementors should
  release an unprefixed implementation of any CR-level feature they
  can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according to spec.

  <p>To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across
  implementations, the CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental
  CSS renderers submit an implementation report (and, if necessary, the
  testcases used for that implementation report) to the W3C before
  releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
  submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS
  Working Group.

  <p>Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports
  can be found from on the CSS Working Group's website at
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>.
  Questions should be directed to the
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a>
  mailing list.

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:

  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.

    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.

    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:

    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.

      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”).
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.

      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>

  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.

      <p>
        While ''text-decoration-line: blink'' can't be fully reproduced with other existing properties,
        authors can achieve a very similar effect with the following CSS:

      <pre>
<!-- -->@keyframes blink {
<!-- -->  0% {
<!-- -->    visibility: hidden;
<!-- -->    animation-timing-function: step-end;
<!-- -->  }
<!-- -->  25%, 100% {

<!-- -->blink {
<!-- -->  animation: blink 1s infinite;
