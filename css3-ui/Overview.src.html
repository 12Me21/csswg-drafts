<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This section is <em>informative</em>.</p>

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing the rendering of
HTML and XML documents on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. It uses various selectors, properties and values to style basic user interface elements in a document. This specification describes those user interface related selectors, properties and values that are proposed for CSS level&nbsp;3 to style HTML and XML (including XHTML and XForms). It includes and extends user interface related features from the selectors, properties and values of CSS level&nbsp;2 revision 1 and Selectors specifications.
</p>

<h2 style="page-break-before:auto" class="no-num no-toc" id="status">Status of this document</h2>

<!--status-->

<p>This specification is a <strong>Last Call Working
Draft</strong>, although it was previously a Candidate Recommendation.
It has been returned to Last Call Working Draft because this draft removes
features that were not implemented sufficiently to advance to Proposed
Recommendation, and had not been previously listed as at risk, as <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">required</a>
by the W3C Process.  
This draft also adds a couple of new properties and values.
See <a href="#changes">Appendix C. Changes</a> for further details.
<!-- This specification may advance directly to Proposed
Recommendation following the last call, depending on comments and
implementation reports. -->
All persons are encouraged to review this
document and send comments to the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">www-style
mailing list</a> as described above.  The <strong>deadline for
comments</strong> is 
<strong>SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE AFTER A PUBLIC LCWD IS PUBLISHED</strong>.
</p>

<h3 class="no-num no-toc" id="crec">Candidate Recommendation Exit Criteria</h3>

<p>For this specification to enter the Proposed Recommendation stage,
the following conditions shall be met:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>There must be at least two interoperable implementations
   for every feature. For the purposes of this criterion,
   we define the following terms:</p>
   <dl>
    <dt>feature</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      A section or subsection of the specification.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>interoperable</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>passing the respective test cases in the test suite, or,
     if the implementation is not a web browser, equivalent tests.
     Every relevant test in the test suite should have an equivalent
     test created if such a user agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability.
     In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
     then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass
     those equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
     interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
     available for the purposes of peer review.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>
     <p>a user agent which:</p>
     <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the feature.</li>
      <li>is available (i.e. publicly downloadable or available
      through some other public point of sale mechanism). This is the
      "show me" requirement.</li>
      <li>is shipping (i.e. development, private or unofficial
      versions are insufficient).</li>
      <li>is not experimental (i.e. is intended for a wide audience
      and could be used on a daily basis).</li>
     </ol>
    </dd>
   </dl>
  </li>
  <li><p>A minimum of six months of the CR period must have elapsed.
  This is to ensure that enough time is given for any remaining major
  errors to be caught.</p></li>
  <li><p>The CR period will be extended if implementations are slow to
  appear.</p></li>
  <li><p>Features that are <em>at risk</em> (see the below list) will be dropped (thus reducing the list of "all" features mentioned above) if two or more
   interoperable implementations of those features are not found by
   the end of the CR period, or if sufficient and adequate
  tests (by judgment of the Working Group) have not been produced for
  those features by the end of the CR period.</p></li>
 </ol>

<p>A <a href="/Style/CSS/Test/">test suite</a> and a <a
href="/Style/css3-updates/css3-ui-implementations">report on
implementations</a> will be provided before the document becomes a
Proposed Recommendation.
</p>


<h3 class="no-num no-toc" id="atrisk">Features at risk</h3>

<p>The Working Group has identified the following features as at risk of being removed from CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3 when exiting CR. Implementors are urged to implement these features, if they wish to see these features remain in this specification.  All other features are either defined in a normative reference (e.g. CSS 2.1 [[!CSS21]] or Selectors [[!SELECT]]) or are believed to have two or more implementations, and thus will not be dropped without returning to last call.</p>
<ul>
 <!--

<h2 class="no-num no-toc" id="summary">Overview</h2>

<p>This section is <em>informative</em>.</p>

<p>This document is one of the "modules" for the upcoming CSS3
specification. It not only describes the user interface related 
properties and values that already exist in 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">CSS1</a> [[CSS1]]
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21">CSS2.1</a> [[!CSS21]], but introduces
new properties and values for CSS3 as well. 
The Working Group doesn't expect that all implementations of CSS3 will implement 
all properties or values. Instead, there will probably be a small number of variants of CSS3, so-called "profiles".
</p>

<p>This document is the result of the merging of relevant parts of
the following Recommendations and Working Drafts, and the addition of some new features.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Cascading Style Sheets, level 2, revision 1 [[!CSS21]]</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-css3-userint-20000216">User Interface for CSS3 (16 February 2000)</a> [[CSSUI]]</li>
</ul>

<p>This specification contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to style 
user interface states and element fragments respectively.
</li>
<li>Additions to the user interface features in 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21">CSS2.1</a>.</li>
<li>Directional focus navigation properties.</li>
<li>A mechanism to allow the styling of elements as icons for accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>This section is <em>normative</em>.</p>

<p>
CSS3 is a set of modules, divided up and profiled in order to 
simplify the specification, and to allow implementors the flexibility of supporting the particular modules appropriate for their implementations.
</p>
<p>
This module describes selectors and CSS properties which enable authors 
to style user interface related states, element fragments, properties 
and values.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1#anchor-pseudo-classes">Section 2.1 of CSS1</a> [[CSS1]]
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ui.html">Chapter 18 of CSS2</a> [[CSS2]] 
introduced several user interface related pseudo-classes, properties and values. 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#UIstates">Section 6.6.4 of Selectors</a> [[!SELECT]] also describes several additional user interface related pseudo-classes (and one pseudo-element).
</p>
<p>
This Working Draft extends them to provide the ability, through CSS, 
to style elements based upon additional user interface states, 
to style fragments of user interface elements, and to alter the 
dynamic presentation of elements in ways previously only available through specific HTML4/XHTML1 elements and attributes.
</p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of this specification is to achieve the following objectives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the user interface features in CSS2.1.</li>
<li>Provide additional CSS mechanisms to augment or replace other 
dynamic presentation related features in HTML4/XHTML1.</li>
<li>Introduce directional navigation properties to assist in the construction of 
user interfaces which make use of a directional navigation model.</li>
<li>Introduce properties and values to specify icon presentations for 
elements to enhance accessibility.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conformance</h2>

<p>This section is <em>normative</em>.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>The key words <span class="index-def" title="MUST">"MUST"</span>,
<span class="index-def" title="MUST NOT">"MUST NOT"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="REQUIRED">"REQUIRED"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="SHALL">"SHALL"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="SHALL NOT">"SHALL NOT"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="SHOULD">"SHOULD"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="SHOULD NOT">"SHOULD NOT"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="RECOMMENDED">"RECOMMENDED"</span>, <span
class="index-def" title="MAY">"MAY"</span>, and <span
class="index-def" title="OPTIONAL">"OPTIONAL"</span> in this document
are to be interpreted as described in RFC&nbsp;2119 (see [[!RFC2119]]).
However, for readability, these words do not typically appear in all uppercase
letters in this specification.
</p>

<p>Additional key words, e.g. "User agent (UA)", are <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#defs">defined by CSS 2.1</a> ([[!CSS21]], section 3.1).</p>

<h3>Classes of products</h3>

<p>The following classes of products (many of which overlap) should consider implementing this specification:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web browsers</li>
<li>User agents that implement one or more of the following types of content: HTML ([[HTML401]], [[HTML5]]), XHTML ([[XHTML10]], [[XHTML11]]), XForms (e.g. [[XFORMS11]]), SVG (e.g. [[SVG10]], [[SVG11]]) or other content languages that contain forms controls or are intended for user interaction</li>
<li>User agents that implement one or more levels, modules and or profiles of CSS (e.g. [[CSS1]], [[!CSS21]])</li>
</ul>

<h3>Profiles</h3>

<p>This specification contains a number of informative profiles.  These profiles are not mandatory for conformance.</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>This specification does not define any explicit extension mechanisms.  If an implementation needs to extend the functionality of this specification, it must follow any/all guidelines and requirements of extensions as defined in CSS2.1, e.g. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">Vendor-specific extensions</a> ([[!CSS21]], section 4.1.2.1).
</p>


<h2>Dependencies on other modules</h2>

<p>This section is <em>normative</em>.</p>

<p>This CSS3 module depends on the following other specifications.  Some of these specifications may be in their "Candidate Recommendation" phase.  If this module depends on feature or portion of such a specification which ends up being dropped during their "CR" phase(s), then such feature or portion thereof will be presumed to be incorporated into this specification.  For example, if the ":indeterminate" selector was dropped from Selectors, then the definition and description of ":indeterminate" would be incorporated into the next draft of this specification.</p>

<ul>
<li>[[!SELECT]]</li>
<li>[[!CSS3COLOR]]</li>
<li>[[!CSS21]]</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>It has non-normative (informative) references to the following
other specifications:</p>
<ul>
</ul>
-->

<p>
The following work is related to the CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3 (CSS3 Basic UI).
</p>

<ul>
<li>[[HTML401]]</li>
<li>[[HTML5]]</li>
<li>[[UAAG10]]</li>
<li>[[XML10]]</li>
<li>[[XHTML10]]</li>
<li>[[XHTML11]]</li>
<li>[[XFORMS11]]</li>
</ul>

<p>This specification does not define what is a form element.</p>

<h2>User Interface Selectors</h2>

<p>This section is <em>normative</em>.</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-classes">User interface states: pseudo-classes</h3>
<p>The Selectors specification <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#UIstates">defines several user interface selectors</a> ([[!SELECT]], sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.4) which represent 
user interface states:</p>
<ul><li id="psuedo-hover"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#useraction-pseudos">:hover</a></li>
	<li id="pseudo-active"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#useraction-pseudos">:active</a></li>
	<li id="pseudo-focus"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#useraction-pseudos">:focus</a></li>
	<li id="pseudo-enabled"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#enableddisabled">:enabled</a></li>
	<li id="pseudo-disabled"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#enableddisabled">:disabled</a></li>
	<li id="pseudo-checked"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#checked">:checked</a></li>
	<li id="pseudo-indeterminate"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#indeterminate">:indeterminate</a></li>
</ul>
	
<p>These pseudo-classes as defined by [[!SELECT]] are included in this specification by reference.</p>

<p>CSS 2.1 [[!CSS21]] specifies additional details for some of the selectors mentioned, above and beyond Selectors.
</p>


<h4 id="active">:active details</h4>

<p>In addition, on systems with more than one mouse button, :active is clarified to apply only to the primary or primary activation button (typically the "left" mouse button), and any aliases thereof.</p>

<h4 class="no-num no-toc">New user interface state pseudo-classes</h4>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned pseudo-classes, this specification introduces several new pseudo-classes to define additional user interface states.
</p>
<ul><li>:default</li>
	<li>:valid</li>
	<li>:invalid</li>
	<li>:in-range</li>
	<li>:out-of-range</li>
	<li>:required</li>
	<li>:optional</li>
	<li>:read-only</li>
	<li>:read-write</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, these new states (except for :default) are provided as a way to style elements which are in the respective states as defined by XForms [[XFORMS11]].</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-default">:default</h4>
<p>The :default selector applies to the one or more UI elements that are the default among a set of similar elements.  Typically applies to context menu items, buttons and select lists/menus.
</p>
<p>
One example is the default submit button among a set of buttons.  Another example is the default option from a popup menu.  Multiple elements in a select-many group could have multiple :default elements, like a selection of pizza toppings for example.
</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-validity"><span id="pseudo-valid">:valid</span> 
and <span id="pseudo-invalid">:invalid</span></h4>

<p>An element is :valid or :invalid when it is,
respectively, valid or invalid with respect to data validity semantics 
defined by a different specification (e.g. [[XFORMS11]]).  
An element which lacks data validity semantics is neither :valid nor :invalid.  This is different from an element which otherwise has no constraints. Such an element would always be :valid.
</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-range"><span id="pseudo-in-range">:in-range</span> and <span id="pseudo-out-of-range">:out-of-range</span></h4>
<p>
The :in-range and :out-of-range pseudo-classes apply only to elements that have range limitations.  An element is :in-range or :out-of-range when the value that the element is bound to is in range or out of range of the presentation (e.g. visual or spoken representation) of the element respectively.  An element that lacks data range limits or is not a form control is neither :in-range nor
:out-of-range.  E.g. a slider element with a value of 11 presented as a slider control that only represents the values from 1-10 is :out-of-range.  Another example is a menu element with a value of "E" that happens to be presented as a popup menu that only has choices "A", "B" and "C".
</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-required-value"><span id="pseudo-required">:required</span> 
and <span id="pseudo-optional">:optional</span></h4>

<p>A form element is :required or :optional if a value for it
is, respectively, required or optional before the form it belongs to is submitted.  Elements that are not form elements are neither required nor optional.
</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-ro-rw"><span id="pseudo-read-only">:read-only</span> 
and <span id="pseudo-read-write">:read-write</span></h4>

<p>An element whose contents are not user-alterable is :read-only. 
However, elements whose contents are user-alterable (such as text input fields) are considered to be in a :read-write state.  In typical documents, 
most elements are :read-only. However it may be possible (e.g. in the context of an editor) for any element to become :read-write.</p>


<h3 id="pseudo-elements">User interface element fragments: pseudo-elements</h3>

<p>Selectors ([[!SELECT]], section 7.3) also defines one user interface element fragment selector:</p>
<ul><li id="pseudo-selection"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selection">::selection</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This pseudo-element is included in this specification as defined by [[!SELECT]] by reference.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned pseudo-element, this specification introduces four new pseudo-elements to provide access to additional user interface element fragments.
</p>
<ul><li>::value</li>
	<li>::choices</li>
	<li>::repeat-item</li>
	<li>::repeat-index</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically, these new pseudo-elements are provided as a way to style user interface fragments as defined by XForms [[XFORMS11]].</p>


<h4 id="pseudo-value">::value</h4>

<p>A form element may contain both a label for its data value, 
and the data value itself. For such elements, the ::value pseudo-element 
selects the representation of just the data value itself, in order to 
style its appearance.
</p>

<div class="example"><p style="display:none">Example(s):</p>
<h4 class="no-num no-toc">fictional markup and illustration</h4>
<p>
Here is an example which illustrates the ::value of a text input field with fictional markup which is then styled with CSS.
</p>
<h5 class="no-num no-toc">sample XForms fragment with fictional markup:</h5>
<pre><code>
&lt;input&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Zip code&lt;label&gt;
  <em>&lt;input::value/&gt;</em>
&lt;/input&gt;
</code></pre>

<h5 class="no-num no-toc">sample CSS:</h5>
<pre><code class="css">
input { border:dashed }
label { border:dotted }
input::value { border:solid }
</code></pre>

<h5 class="no-num no-toc">an HTML+CSS approximation of this example</h5>
<p>
<span style="border:dashed;display:inline-block;padding:10px">
 <label 
  style="border:dotted;display:inline-block;padding:2px;margin:0;font-size:1em"
 >Zip code</label>
 <input type="text" 
  style="border:solid;display:inline-block;padding:2px;margin:0;font-size:1em"
  value="94117">
</span>
</p>
<p>Spacing (in the form of padding) has been added to the above approximation to separate the borders and make the individual (pseudo-)elements easier to distinguish.
</p>
</div>

<p>The ::value pseudo-element is similar to an inline-level element, but with certain restrictions.
The following properties apply to <code>::value</code>
pseudo-element: font properties, color property, background properties, 
'word-spacing', 'letter-spacing', 'text-decoration', 'vertical-align', 
'text-transform', 'line-height'.  UAs may apply other properties as well.
</p>


<h4 id="pseudo-choices">::choices</h4>

<p>Similarly, a form element which represents a list of options may contain 
both a label for the list, and the list of choices itself.  For such elements, the ::choices pseudo-element selects the representation of just the list of choices themselves, in order to style their appearance.
</p>
<p>A list of radio buttons can also be selected with the ::choices pseudo-element, and the currently chosen radio button can be selected with the ::value pseudo-element.</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-repeat-item">::repeat-item</h4>
<p>
The ::repeat-item pseudo-element represents a single item from a repeating sequence. It is generated as a parent to all the elements in a single repeating item. Each ::repeat-item is associated with a particular instance data node, and is affected by the model item properties (e.g. '<code>relevant</code>') found there, as the related style properties will cascade to the child elements.
</p>

<h4 id="pseudo-repeat-index">::repeat-index</h4>
<p>
The ::repeat-index pseudo-element represents the current item of a repeating sequence. It takes the place of the ::repeat-item as a parent of all the elements in the index repeating item.
</p>

<div class="note"><p>
<em><strong>Note.</strong> 
Any style declarations that an author wants to apply to all repeat items, including the index, must be done so by using both ::repeat-item and ::repeat-index selectors.  Styles that are only applied to ::repeat-item will not automatically be applied to the respective ::repeat-index.

Here is an example that illustrates both ::repeat-item and ::repeat-index, since they are often both available and used at the same time.  Assume appropriate namespace declarations were made in a header somewhere preceding the code in the example.
</p>
<p>The following markup snippet uses XHTML and XForms:</p>
<pre><code lang="x-xhtml">

   &lt;/html:tr&gt;
&lt;/html:table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The following style rules are used to style all the repeated items and the current repeated item.
</p>
<pre><code class="css" lang="x-css">

The following fictional markup shows the state of the above markup when through user interaction the XForm contains three of the repeated items, where the third item is current.
</p>
<pre><code lang="x-xhtml">

<h2>Outline properties</h2>

<p>This section is <em>normative</em>.</p>

<p>At times, style sheet authors may want to create outlines around
visual objects such as buttons, active form fields, image maps, etc.,
to make them stand out. Outlines differ from borders in the following
ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Outlines do not take up space. </li>
<li>Outlines may be non-rectangular. </li>
</ol>

<p>The outline properties control the style of these dynamic outlines.

</tbody></table>

<p>The outline created with the outline properties is drawn "over" a
box, i.e., the outline is always on top, and doesn't influence the
position or size of the box, or of any other boxes. Therefore,
displaying or suppressing outlines does not cause reflow.
</p>

<p>Outlines may be non-rectangular. 
For example, if the element is broken across several lines, the
outline should be an outline or minimum set of outlines that encloses all 
the element's boxes.  Each part of the outline should be fully connected
rather than open on some sides (as borders on inline elements are when
lines are broken).  The parts of the outline are not required to be
rectangular.  The position of the outline may be affected by
descendant boxes.  User agents should use an algorithm for determining
the outline that encloses a region appropriate for conveying the
concept of focus to the user.
</p>

<p>The <span class=property>'outline-width'</span> property accepts 
the same values as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-width" class="noxref"><span
class="propinst-border-width">'border-width'</span></a> ([[!CSS21]], section 8.5.1).  
</p>

<p>The <span class=property>'outline-style'</span> property accepts 
the same values as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#propdef-border-style" class="noxref"><span
class="propinst-border-style">'border-style'</span></a> ([[!CSS21]], section 8.5.3),
except that '<span class="value">hidden</span>' is not a legal outline style.  In addition, in CSS3, <span class=property>'outline-style'</span> accepts the value '<span class="value">auto</span>'.  The '<span class="value">auto</span>' value permits the user agent to render a custom outline style, typically a style which is either a user interface default for the platform, or perhaps a style that is richer than can be described in detail in CSS, e.g. a rounded edge outline with semi-translucent outer pixels that appears to glow.  As such, this specification does not define how the <span class="property">'outline-color'</span> is incorporated or used (if at all) when rendering '<span class="value">auto</span>' style outlines.  User agents may treat '<span class="value">auto</span>' as '<span class="value">solid</span>'.
</p>

<p>The <span class="property">'outline-color'</span> property 
accepts all colors, as well as the keyword '<dfn>invert</dfn>'. 'Invert' is expected to perform a color inversion on the pixels on the screen. This is a
common trick to ensure the focus border is visible, regardless of
color background.
</p>

<p>
Conformant UAs may ignore the '<span class="value">invert</span>' value on platforms that do not support color inversion of the pixels on the screen.  If the UA does not support the '<span class="value">invert</span>' value then the initial value of the <span class="property">'outline-color'</span> 
property is the '<span class="value">currentColor</span>' [[!CSS3COLOR]] keyword.
</p>

<p>The <span class=property>'outline'</span> property is a
shorthand property, and sets all three of <span class=property>'outline-style'</span>, <span class=property>'outline-width'</span>, and <span class=property>'outline-color'</span>.
</p>

<p class="note"><em><strong>Note.</strong> 
The outline is the same on all sides.  In contrast to borders, there are no 'outline-top' or 'outline-left' etc. properties.</em>
</p>

<p>
This specification does not define how multiple overlapping
outlines are drawn, or how outlines are drawn for boxes that are
partially obscured behind other elements.
</p>

<div class="example"><p style="display:none">Example(s):</p><p>
Here's an example of drawing a
thick outline around a BUTTON element:
</p>
<pre><code class="css">
button { outline: thick solid }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Graphical user interfaces may use outlines around elements to tell
the user which element on the page has the focus. These outlines are in addition
to any borders, and switching outlines on and off should not cause
the document to reflow. The focus is the subject of user interaction
in a document (e.g., for entering text, selecting a button,
etc.).
</p>

<div class="example"><p style="display:none">Example(s):</p>
<p>For example, to draw a thick black line around an element when it
has the focus, and a thick red line when it is active, the following
rules can be used:
</p>
<pre><code class="css">
:focus  { outline: thick solid black }
:active { outline: thick solid red }
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="note"><p>
<em><strong>Note.</strong>
Since the outline does not affect formatting (i.e., no
space is left for it in the box model), it may well overlap
other elements on the page.
</em></p>
</div>



<h3 id="outline-offset"><span class="property">'outline-offset'</span> property</h3>

<p>By default, the outline is drawn starting just outside the border edge. 
However, it is possible to offset the outline and draw it beyond the border edge.</p>

<table class="propdef" id="propdef-outline-offset"><tbody>
<tr><th>Name:</th><td><dfn>outline-offset</dfn></td></tr>
<tr><th>Value:</th><td>&lt;length&gt; | inherit</td></tr>
<tr><th>Initial:</th><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><th>Applies to:</th><td>all elements</td></tr>
<tr><th>Inherited:</th><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><th>Percentages:</th><td>N/A</td></tr>
<tr><th>Media:</th><td>visual</td></tr>
<tr><th>Computed&nbsp;value:</th><td>&lt;length&gt; value in absolute units (px or physical).</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If the computed value of <span class="property">'outline-offset'</span> is anything other than 0, then the outline is outset from the border edge by that amount.</p>


<div class="example"><p style="display:none">Example(s):</p>
<p>For example, to leave 2 pixels of space between a focus outline and the element that has the focus, or is active, the following rule can be used:
</p>
<pre><code class="css">
:focus,:active  { outline-offset: 2px }
</code></pre>
</div>



<h2>Resizing &amp; Overflow</h2>

<p>This section is <em>normative</em>.</p>

<p>CSS2.1 provides a mechanism for controlling the appearance of a scrolling mechanism (e.g. scrollbars) on block container elements.  
This specification adds to that a mechanism for controlling 
user resizability of elements as well as the ability to specify text overflow behavior.</p>

<h3 id="resize"><span class="property">'resize'</span> property</h3>
<p>The <span class="property">'resize'</span> property allows the author to specify whether or not an element is resizable by the user, and if so, along which axis/axes.</p>

<table class="propdef" id="propdef-resize"><tbody>
<tr><th>Name:</th><td><dfn>resize</dfn></td></tr>
<tr><th>Value: </th><td>none | both | horizontal | vertical | inherit</td></tr>
<tr><th>Initial:</th><td>none</td></tr>
<tr><th>Applies to:</th><td>elements with <span class="property">'overflow'</span> other than visible</td></tr>
<tr><th>Inherited:</th><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><th>Percentages:</th><td>N/A</td></tr>
<tr><th>Media:</th><td>visual</td></tr>
<tr><th>Computed&nbsp;value:</th><td>specified value.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<dl>
<dt>none</dt>
<dd>The UA does not present a resizing mechanism on the element, and the user is given no direct manipulation mechanism to resize the element.</dd>
<dt>both</dt>
<dd>The UA presents a bidirectional resizing mechanism to 
allow the user to adjust both the height and the width of the element.</dd>
<dt>horizontal</dt>
<dd>The UA presents a unidirectional horizontal resizing mechanism to allow the user to adjust only the width of the element.</dd>
<dt>vertical</dt>
<dd>The UA presents a unidirectional vertical resizing mechanism to allow the user to adjust only the height of the element.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Currently it is possible to control the appearance of the scrolling mechanism (if any) on an element using the <span class="property">'overflow'</span> property (e.g. '<code class="css">overflow: scroll</code>' vs. '<code class="css">overflow: hidden</code>' etc.).  The purpose of the <span class="property">'resize'</span> property is to also allow control over the appearance and function of the resizing mechanism (e.g. a resize box or widget) on the element.</p>
<p class="note">
<em><strong>Note.</strong> 
The resizing mechanism is NOT the same as the scrolling mechanism.  The scrolling mechanism allows the user to determine which portion of the contents of an element is shown. The resizing mechanism allows the user to determine the size of the element.
</em></p>
<p>The <span class="property">'resize'</span> property applies to elements whose computed <span class="property">'overflow'</span> value is something other than '<span class="value">visible</span>'.  If <span class="property">'overflow'</span> is different in a particular axis (i.e. <span class="property">'overflow-x'</span> vs. <span class="property">'overflow-y'</span>), then this property applies to the dimension(s) which do not have the value '<span class="value">visible</span>'.
</p>
<p>
When an element is resized by the user, the user agent keeps track of a resize factor (which is initially 1.0) for the width and height, which it then applies to the computed width and height as part of determining the used width and height.  The element's contents (and surroundings) are reformatted as necessary.
</p>
<p>The resize factor introduces a step in width/height calculations and formatting as described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html">chapter 10 of CSS2.1</a>.  Specifically the following  step is inserted between steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#min-max-widths">section 10.4</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#min-max-heights">10.7</a> in CSS2.1 [[!CSS21]], where [dimension] is 'width' for 10.4 and 'height' for 10.7.
</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-indent:-2em">
1b. If the resize [dimension] factor is not 1.0, then the tentative
 used [dimension] is multiplied by that factor, and the rules 
 above are applied again, but this time using the result of that
 multiplication as the computed value for '[dimension]'.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
With regard to interactivity and the Document Object Model (DOM), the resize factor on an element lasts the lifetime of the element, however, if the <span class="property">'resize'</span> property itself is altered (e.g. via pseudo-class change or via DOM manipulation), then the resize factor is reset to 1.0.
</p>
<p>
The precise direction of resizing (i.e. altering the top left of the element or altering the bottom right) may depend on a number of factors including whether the element is absolutely positioned, whether it is positioned using the <span class="property">'right'</span> and <span class="property">'bottom'</span> properties, whether the language of the element is right-to-left etc.  The precise direction of resizing is left to the UA to properly determine for the platform.
</p>
<p>
The user agent may restrict the resizing range to something suitable, such as between the original formatted size of the element, and large enough to encompass all the element's contents.
</p>

<div class="example"><p style="display:none">Example(s):</p>
<p>For example, to make iframes scrollable <em>and</em> resizable, the following rule can be used:
</p>
<pre><code class="css">
iframe,object[type^="text/"],
object[type$="+xml"],object[type="application/xml"] 
{ 
  overflow:auto;
  resize:both;
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<!--
too bad we don't have @viewport yet. otherwise this would be cool:
<pre><code class="css">
@viewport {
       width: 100px; 
       height: 100px;
       overflow: hidden;
       resize: none

other than <span class="value">'visible'</span>. 
Text can overflow for example when it is prevented from wrapping 
(e.g. due to '<code>white-space:nowrap</code>' 
or a single word is too long to fit). 
Values have the following meanings:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><dfn title="text-overflow:clip"><code>clip</code></dfn></dt>
    <dd>Clip inline content that overflows. Characters may be only partially rendered.</dd>

  <dt><dfn title="text-overflow:ellipsis"><code>ellipsis</code></dfn></dt>
    <dd>
Render an ellipsis character (U+2026) 
to represent clipped inline content.  
Implementations may substitute a more language/script-appropriate 
ellipsis character,
or three dots "..." if the ellipsis character is unavailable. 
</dd>
 <dt><dfn title="text-overflow:&lt;string&gt;">
           <var>&lt;string&gt;</var></dfn></dt>
   <dd>
Render the given string to represent clipped inline content. 
The given string is treated as an independent paragraph 
for bidi purposes.
</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note">
Note: The &lt;string&gt; value, and the 2-value syntax "{1,2}" and functionality are all at risk.
</p>

<p>
The term "character" is used in this property definition for better readability and means "grapheme cluster" [[!UAX29]] for implementation purposes.
</p>

<p>
If there is one value, 
it applies only to the end line edge. 
If there are two values,
the first value applies to the left edge, 
and the second value applies to the right edge.
</p>

<p>
For the ellipsis 
and string values,
implementations must hide characters and 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#inline-boxes">
atomic inline-level elements</a> 
at the applicable edge(s) of the line as necessary to fit the ellipsis/string. 
Place the ellipsis/string immediately adjacent 
to the applicable edge(s) of the remaining inline content.
The first character or 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#inline-boxes">
atomic inline-level element</a> 
on a line
must be clipped rather than ellipsed.

<h4 class="no-num no-toc">ellipsing details</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Ellipsing only affects rendering and must not affect layout 
nor dispatching of pointer events.
</li>
<li>
The ellipsis is styled and baseline-aligned according to 
the block.
</li>
<li>
Ellipsing occurs after relative positioning and other graphical transformations.
</li>
<li>
If there is insufficient space for the ellipsis, then clip the rendering of the ellipsis itself (on the same side that neutral characters on the line would have otherwise been clipped with the ''clip'' value).
</li>
<li>When the user is interacting with content (e.g. editing, selecting, scrolling), the user agent may treat text-overflow ''ellipsis'' or string values as ''clip''.

<p class="note">
Note: the side of the line that the ellipsis is placed depends on the 'direction' of the block. E.g. an overflow hidden right-to-left (<code>direction:rtl</code>) block clips inline content on the <em>left</em> side, thus would place a text-overflow ellipsis on the <em>left</em> to represent that clipped content.

<h4 class="no-num no-toc">ellipsis interaction with scrolling interfaces</h4>

<p>
This section applies to elements with text-overflow other than 'clip' 
(non-clip text-overflow) 
and overflow:scroll.
</p>

<p>
When an element with non-clip text-overflow has overflow of scroll 
in the inline progression dimension of the text, and the browser 
provides a mechanism for scrolling (e.g. a scrollbar on the element, 
or a touch interface to swipe-scroll, etc.), there are 
additional implementation details that provide a better user experience:
</p>

<p>
When an element is scrolled (e.g. by the user, DOM manipulation, 
or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/CR-css3-marquee-20081205/#overflow-style">'overflow-style'</a> [[CSS3MARQUEE]]), 
more of the element's content is shown. 
The value of text-overflow should not affect whether more of 
the element's content is shown or not. If a non-clip text-overflow 
is set, then as more content is scrolled into view, 
implementations should show whatever 
additional content fits, only truncating content which would 
otherwise be clipped 
(or is necessary to make room for the ellipsis/string), 
until the element is scrolled far enough to 
display the edge of the content 
at which point that content should be displayed 
rather than an ellipsis/string.
</p>
<p>
As some content is scrolled into view, it is likely that 
other content may scroll out of view on the other side.  
If that content's block container element is the same 
that's doing the scrolling, 
then implementations should render an ellipsis/string in place of 
the clipped content, 
with the same details as described in the value definition above, 
except that the ellipsis/string is drawn in the start 
(rather than end) of 
the block's direction (per the direction property).
</p>
<p>
While the content is being scrolled, implementations may adjust their rendering of ellipses/strings 
(e.g. align to the box edges rather than line edges). 
</p>
<p>
If there is insufficient space for both start 
and end ellipses/strings, 
then only the end ellipsis/string should be rendered.

<p>This property specifies the type of cursor to be displayed for the pointing device when over the element's border, padding, and content. Values have the following meanings:
</p>

<h5 class="no-num no-toc">image cursors</h5>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;uri&gt;</dt>
<dd>The user agent retrieves the cursor from the resource
designated by the URI. If the user agent cannot handle 
the first cursor of a list of cursors, it must attempt
to handle the second, etc. If the user agent cannot handle
any user-defined cursor, it must use the cursor keyword
at the end of the list.  The optional &lt;x&gt; and &lt;y&gt; coordinates 
identify the exact position within the image which is the pointer position (i.e., the hotspot).
</dd>
<dt>&lt;x&gt;</dt>
<dt>&lt;y&gt;</dt>
<dd>
Each is a &lt;number&gt;. The x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the position in the cursor's coordinate system (left/top relative) which represents the precise  position that is being pointed to. 
If the values are unspecified, then the intrinsic hotspot defined inside the image resource itself is used.  If both the values are unspecific and the referenced cursor has no defined hotspot, the effect is as if a value of "0 0" were specified.

</dl>

<p>The UA may treat unsupported values as '<span class="value">auto</span>'. E.g. on platforms that do not have a concept of a '<span class="value">context-menu</span>' cursor, the UA may render '<span class="value">default</span>' or whatever is appropriate.
</p>

<div class="example">
<h5 class="no-num no-toc">Example: cursor fallback</h5>
<p>Here is an example of using several cursor values.</p>
<pre><code class="css">
:link,:visited { 
    cursor: url(example.svg#linkcursor),

            url(hyper.png) 2 3, 
            pointer

<p>This example sets the cursor on all hyperlinks (whether visited or not) 
to an external <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/interact.html#CursorElement">SVG cursor</a> ([[SVG10]], section 16.8.3). 
User agents that don't support SVG cursors would simply skip to the 
next value and attempt to use the "hyper.cur" cursor. 
If that cursor format was also not supported, the UA could attempt to use the "hyper.png" cursor with the explicit hot spot.  Finally if the UA does not support any of those image cursor formats, the UA would skip to the last value
and simply render the '<span class="value">pointer</span>' cursor.

<h4 id="nav-index">Sequential navigation order: the <span class="property">'nav-index'</span> property</h4>
<p>The <span class="property">'nav-index'</span> property is an input-method-neutral way of specifying the sequential navigation order (also known as "tabbing order").
</p>
<table class="propdef" id="propdef-nav-index">
<tr><th>Name:</th><td><dfn>nav-index</dfn></td></tr>

</table>
<dl>
<dt>auto</dt>
<dd>The element's sequential navigation order is assigned automatically by the user agent.</dd>
<dt>&lt;number&gt;</dt>
<dd>The number (which is non-zero and positive) indicates the sequential 
navigation order for the element. '<span class="value">1</span>' means first.  Elements with the same
nav-index value are navigated in document order when that nav-index value is being navigated.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This property is a replacement for the HTML4/XHTML1 attribute '<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.11.1">tabindex</a>' ([[HTML401]], section 17.11.1).  Borrowed and slightly rephrased from the HTML4 Recommendation:
</p>
<p>
This property specifies the position of the current element in the sequential navigation order for the current document.
</p>
<p>
The sequential navigation order defines the order in which elements will receive focus when navigated by the user via the keyboard. The sequential navigation order may include elements nested within other elements.
</p>
<p>
Elements that may receive focus should be navigated by user agents according to the following rules:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Those elements that support the nav-index property and assign a 
positive value to it are navigated first. Navigation proceeds from 
the element with the lowest nav-index value to the element with the 
highest value. Values need not be sequential nor must they begin with 
any particular value. Elements that have identical nav-index values 
should be navigated in document order.</li>
<li>Those elements that do not support the nav-index property or 
support it and assign it a value of '<span class="value">auto</span>' are navigated next. These elements are navigated in document
order.</li>
<li>Elements that are disabled do not participate in the sequential navigation order.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The actual key sequence that causes sequential navigation or element activation depends on the configuration of the user agent (e.g., the "tab" key is often used for sequential navigation, and the "enter" key is used to activate a selected element).
</p>
<p>
User agents may also define key sequences to navigate the sequential navigation order in reverse. When the end (or beginning) of the tabbing order is reached, user agents may circle back to the beginning (or end). The key combination "shift-tab" is often used for reverse sequential navigation.
</p>

<dt>auto</dt>
<dd>The user agent automatically determines which element to navigate the focus to in response to directional navigational input.</dd>
<dt>&lt;id&gt;</dt>
<dd><p>The &lt;id&gt; value consists of a '<code>#</code>' character followed by an identifier, similar to a fragment identifier in a URL.  It indicates the element to which the focus is navigated to in response to directional navigation input respective to the specific property.
</p>
<p>
If the &lt;id&gt; refers to the currently focused element, the directional navigation input respective to the nav- property is ignored &mdash; there is no need to refocus the same element.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lt;target-name&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The &lt;target-name&gt; parameter indicates the target frame for the focus navigation. It is a string and it cannot start with the underscore "_" character. If the specified target frame does not exist, the parameter will be treated as the keyword '<span class="value">current</span>', which means to simply use the frame that the element is in.  The keyword '<span class="value">root</span>' indicates that the user agent should target the full window.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>User agents for devices with directional navigation keys respond by navigating the focus according to four respective nav-* directional navigation properties (nav-up, nav-right, nav-down, nav-left).  This specification does not define which keys of a device are directional navigational keys.
</p>

<div class="note"><p>
<em><strong>Note.</strong> 
Typical personal computers have keyboards with four arrow keys. One possible implementation would be to use those four arrow keys for directional navigation.  For accessibility and user convenience, user agents should allow configuration of which keys on a keyboard are used for directional navigation.
</em></p>
</div>

<div class="example">
<h5 class="no-num no-toc">Example: positioned buttons</h5>
<p>Here is an example of buttons positioned in a diamond shape whose navigation order and directional focus navigation is set in such a way to navigate the focus clockwise (or counter-clockwise) around the diamond shape when the user chooses to navigate sequentially or directionally.</p>
<pre><code class="css">
button { position:absolute }

button#b1 {
	top:0; left:50%;
	nav-index:1;
	nav-right:#b2; nav-left:#b4;

	nav-index:4;
	nav-right:#b1; nav-left:#b3;
	nav-down:#b1; nav-up:#b3;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whatever markup sequence the buttons may have (which is not specified in this example) is irrelevant in this case because they are positioned, and yet, it is still important to ensure focus navigation behaviors which relate reasonably to the specified layout.</p>

<h2 class="no-num" id="changes">Appendix C. Changes</h2>

<p>This appendix is <em>informative</em>.</p>

<p>In general this draft contains numerous editorial/grammatical/spelling corrections, and several new informative examples.  This appendix describes minor functional changes from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-css3-ui-20040511/">Candidate Recommendation (CR)
of 11 May 2004</a> that were made to reflect implementer adoption (or lack thereof) in the seven years since. In particular, changes since the CR fall into one of three categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Minor refinements to features based on implementation experience. 
 <!-- e.g. cursor applying to border, padding, content areas -->
 </li>
<li>Dropping features that were not implemented, or were insufficiently implemented to exit CR.</li>
 <!-- e.g. System Appearance -->
<li>Adding a small number of new but already interoperably implemented features.
 <!-- e.g. text-overflow, ime-mode -->
 </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="no-num" id="changes-list">List of substantial changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>System Appearance has been dropped, 
including appearance values &amp; property, 
and system fonts / extension of the 'font' property shorthand.
</li>

<li>'<span class="property">box-sizing</span>' property. Added 'padding-box' value.</li>

<li>'<span class="property">cursor</span>' property. Added detail about applying to the border, padding, and content areas of the element.</li>

<li>'<span class="property">ime-mode</span>' property - new!</li>

<li>'<span class="property">text-overflow</span>' property - new!</li>

</ul>
