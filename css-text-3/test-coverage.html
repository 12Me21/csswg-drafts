<p>Overall good coverage. Very good i18n coverage.

<p>Missing:

<ul>
	<li>No test of Animation type.
	<li>specifying several values at the same time
</ul>

<p>Possible addition:
<ul>
	<li>An automated test for plain text copy&amp;paste not applying transforms. Not clear such an <em>automated</em> test is possible, but it would be nice to have one if it were.
</ul>

<div class=issue>Issue:

<h2 id="white-space-and-wrapping-the-white-space-property"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-property">White Space and Wrapping: the white-space property</a></h2>

<p>A fair amount of coverage through section 4 (white space processing details) and subsections . Probably well tested by the CSS2 test suite, but I have not checked that.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>applies to inlines (and specifically, wrappable inlines inside white-space:pre blocks don’t get ignored)
	<li>No test of Animation type.
	<li>tests for the nowrap value
	<li>tests for the pre-line value
	<li>intrinsic (min and max) sizing tests for values other than pre-wrap and break-spaces
</ul>

<div class=issue>Issue:
	<p>Problematic tests:

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-text/white-space/pre-wrap-012.html">pre-wrap-012</a> / <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-text/white-space/pre-wrap-013.html">013</a> / <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/css/css-text/white-space/pre-wrap-014.html">014</a> are wrong. end of line spaces must hang.
	</ul>

<h2 id="white-space-processing-details"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-processing">White Space Processing Details</a></h2>

<p>Partial coverage.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>Form feeds (U+000C) (that are not segment breaks) are rendered as a zero-width space (U+200B).
	<li>As required by [UNICODE], unsupported Default_ignorable characters must be ignored for rendering.
</ul>

<h3 id="the-white-space-processing-rules">The <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-rules">White Space Processing Rules</a></h3>

<p>Test only needed in subsections.

<h4 id="phase-i-collapsing-and-transformation"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-phase-1">Phase I: Collapsing and Transformation</a></h4>

<p>Partial coverage.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>“All spaces and tabs immediately preceding or following a segment break are removed.” for nowrap and pre-line
	<li>“Every tab is converted to a space (U+0020).” for nowrap and pre-line
	<li>“Any space immediately following another collapsible space[…]is collapsed[…]” for nowrap and pre-line
</ul>

<p>Possible addition:

<ul>
	<li>Turn example 4 into a test
</ul>

<div class=issue>Issue
	<p>Spec problem:

	<ul>
		<li>“If white-space is set to pre, pre-wrap, or break-spaces any sequence of spaces is treated as a sequence of non-breaking spaces. However, a soft wrap opportunity exists at the end of the sequence.” =&gt; Second sentence weird. That’t not true for “pre”, and only partially true for “break-spaces”.
	</ul>
</div>

<h4 id="segment-break-transformation-rules"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-break-transform">Segment Break Transformation Rules</a></h4>

<p>Partial coverage.

<p>Indirectly tested, no dedicated tests, and not covering all the values:

<ul>
	<li>When white-space is pre, pre-wrap, break-spaces, or pre-line, segment breaks are not collapsible and are instead transformed into a preserved line feed (U+000A).
	<li>For other values of white-space, segment breaks are collapsible. (indirectly covered by other tests, but not for every value of the property)
</ul>

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>None of the statements in this section are tested for “nowrap”
	<li>“Otherwise, if the writing system of the segment break is Chinese, Japanese, or Yi, […]”
	<li>For this purpose, Emoji (Unicode property Emoji) with an East Asian Width property of W or N are treated as having an East Asian Width property of A.
</ul>

<h4 id="phase-ii-trimming-and-positioning"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-phase-2">Phase II: Trimming and Positioning</a></h4>

<p>Good coverage of the behavior, but not for all values of the white-space property.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>No statements made in this section has tests for nowrap and pre-line
	<li>See [UAX9] for rules on how U+0009 tabulation interacts with bidi.
</ul>

<h3 id="tab-character-size-the-tab-size-property"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#tab-size-property">Tab Character Size: the tab-size property</a></h3>

<p>Partial coverage.

<p>Missing tests
<ul>
	<li>No test of Animation type.
	<li>“including its associated letter-spacing and word-spacing”
</ul>

<h2 id="line-breaking-and-word-boundaries"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-breaking">Line Breaking and Word Boundaries</a></h2>

<p>Tests not really needed: these are definitions, they get tested through their applications, not standalone.

<p>Can be a good section to host tests for i18n requirements not covered in detail by the spec.

<p>Possible Additions:

<ul>
	<li>Basic line breaking tests for any language mentioned (Thai, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, Balinese, Yi…)
</ul>

<div class=issue>Issue:
	The following tests need to be reviewed for correctness: i18n/css3-text-line-break-baspglwj-( >002, &lt;120) and i18n/css3-text-line-break-opclns-*
</div>

<h3 id="line-breaking-details"><a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#line-break-details">Line Breaking Details</a></h3>

<p>Spotty Coverage.

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>“Regardless of the white-space value […] the BK, NL […] classes […] must be honored”
	<li>tests of WJ, ZW, and GL (and ZWJ?) for values of white-space other than normal
	<li>The line breaking behavior of a replaced element or other atomic inline is equivalent to an ideographic character
	<li>additionally, for Web-compatibility, introduces a soft wrap opportunity between itself and any adjacent U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE character
	<li>For soft wrap opportunities created by characters that disappear at the line break (e.g. U+0020 SPACE), properties on the box directly containing that character control the line breaking at that opportunity.
	<li>For soft wrap opportunities before the first or after the last character of a box, the break occurs immediately before/after the box (at its margin edge) rather than breaking the box between its content edge and the content.
</ul>

<p>Untestable(?):

<ul>
	<li>UAs that allow wrapping at punctuation other than spaces should prioritize breakpoints. […]
</ul>

<div class=issue>Issue:
	<p>Spec problems(?):

	<ul>
		<li>“Regardless of the white-space value, lines always break at each preserved forced break character: thus for all values, line-breaking behavior defined for the BK, CR, LF, CM, NL, and SG line breaking classes in [UAX14] must be honored. “
			<ul>
				<li>CR is just U+0D, which is already handled in Section <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#white-space-processing">White Space Processing Details</a>. Doesn’t that make this statement moot for that class?
				<li>LF is just U+0A, which isn’t preserved “regardless of the white-space value”. Also, it is adequately described in the white space section.
				<li>How is CM a forced break?
				<li>How is SG a forced break? Also, UAX 14 says: The use of this line breaking class is deprecated.
			</ul>
			=&gt; Suggestion remove CR LF CM and SG from this sentence (keep BK and NL).
		
		<li>“Except where explicitly defined otherwise line breaking behavior defined for the WJ, ZW, and GL line-breaking classes in [UAX14] must be honored.”<br>
		=> Shouldn’t that include the ZWJ class as well?
	</ul>
</div>

	<li>and/or non-letter typographic character units belonging to the NU, AL, AI, or ID Unicode line breaking classes [UAX14]
	<li>It does not affect rules governing the soft wrap opportunities created by spaces (including U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE)
	<li>effect of word-break:keep-all on NU and AI classes
	<li>Symbols that line-break the same way as letters of a particular category are affected the same way as those letters.
	<li>does not suppress <code>&lt;wbr></code>
	<li>line-break:anywhere wins over word-break:keep-all
</ul>

<p>Covered, but could have more:

	<li>If (after justification, if any) the inline contents of a line box are too long to fit within it, then the contents are start-aligned: any content that doesn’t fit overflows the line box’s end edge.
	<li>If the UA chooses to adjust the text, then it must ensure that tab stops continue to line up
	<li>“Values other than justify-all or match-parent are assigned to text-align-all and reset text-align-last to auto.”, and being a shorthand in general

<p>Missing tests:

<ul>
	<li>For the purposes of CSS Text, the properties of a typographic character unit are given by the base character of its first grapheme cluster—except in two cases:
	<li>Grapheme clusters formed with an Enclosing Mark (Me) of the Common script are considered to be Other Symbols (So) in the Common script. They are assumed to have the same Unicode properties as the Replacement Character U+FFFD.
	<li>Grapheme clusters formed with a Space Separator (Zs) as the base are considered to be Modifier Symbols (Sk). They are assumed to have the same East Asian Width property as the base, but take their other properties from the first combining character in the sequence.
</ul>

<p>Adequate Coverage.
