Abstract: The specification describes a CSS box model optimized for user interface design. In the flex layout model, the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can “flex” their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent. Both horizontal and vertical alignment of the children can be easily manipulated. Nesting of these boxes (horizontal inside vertical, or vertical inside horizontal) can be used to build layouts in two dimensions.

<h2 id="intro">
Introduction</h2>

	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		CSS 2.1 defined four layout modes &mdash; algorithms which determine
		the size and position of boxes based on their relationships
		with their sibling and ancestor boxes:

	<ul class="compact">
		<li>block layout, designed for laying out documents
		<li>inline layout, designed for laying out text
		<li>table layout, designed for laying out 2D data in a tabular format
		<li>positioned layout, designed for very explicit positioning without much regard for other elements in the document
	</ul>

	<p>
		This module introduces a new layout mode, <dfn export>flex layout</dfn>,
		which is designed for laying out more complex applications and webpages.

<h3 id="overview">
Overview</h3>
	<p><em>This section is not normative.</em>

	<p>
		Flex layout is superficially similar to block layout.
		It lacks many of the more complex text- or document-centric properties
		that can be used in block layout, such as
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#floats">floats</a> and
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">columns</a>.
		In return it gains simple and powerful tools
		for distributing space and aligning content
		in ways that webapps and complex web pages often need.
		The contents of a flex container:
	<ul>
		<li>
			can be laid out in any <a href="#flex-direction-property">flow direction</a>
			(leftwards, rightwards, downwards, or even upwards!)
		<li>
			can have their display order <a href="#valuedef-row-reverse">reversed</a> or
			<a href="#order-property">rearranged</a> at the style layer
			(i.e., visual order can be independent of source and speech order)
		<li>
			can be laid out linearly along a single (<i title="main axis">main</i>) axis or
			<a href="#flex-wrap-property">wrapped</a> into multiple lines along a secondary (<i title="cross axis">cross</i>) axis
		<li>
			can <a href="#flexibility">&ldquo;flex&rdquo; their sizes</a>
			to respond to the available space
		<li>
			can be <a href="#alignment">aligned</a> with respect to their container or each other
		<li>
			can be dynamically <a href="#visibility-collapse">collapsed</a> or uncollapsed
			along the <i>main axis</i> while preserving the container's <i>cross size</i>
	</ul>

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Here's an example of a catalog where each item has a title, an photo, a description, and a purchase button.
			The designer's intention is that each entry has the same overall size,
			that the photo be above the text,
			and that the purchase buttons aligned at the bottom, regardless of the length of the item's description.
			Flex layout makes many aspects of this design easy:

		<ul>
			<li>
				The catalog uses flex layout to lay out rows of items horizontally,
				and to ensure that items within a row are all equal-height.
				Each entry is then itself a column flex container,
				laying out its contents vertically.

			<li>
				Within each entry, the source document content is ordered logically
				with the title first, followed by the description and the photo.
				This provides a sensible ordering for speech rendering and in non-CSS browsers.
				For a more compelling visual presentation, however,
				'order' is used to pull the image up from later in the content to the top,
				and 'align-self' is used to center it horizontally.

			<li>
				An <a href="#auto-margins"><span class=css>auto</span> margin</a> above the purchase button
				forces it to the bottom within each entry box,
				regardless of the height of that item's description.
		</ul>

Module interactions</h3>

	<p>
		This module extends the definition of the 'display' property [[!CSS21]],
		adding a new block-level and new inline-level display type,
		and defining a new type of formatting context
		along with properties to control its layout.
		None of the properties defined in this module apply to the ''::first-line'' or ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	<p>
		This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]].
		Value types not defined in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
		Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types:
		for example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module,
		expands the definition of the <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> value type as used in this specification.

	<p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties defined in this specification also accept the ''inherit'' keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated explicitly.

<h2 id='box-model'>
Flex Layout Box Model and Terminology</h2>

	<p>
		A <dfn export>flex container</dfn> is the box generated by an element with a
		computed 'display' of ''flex'' or ''inline-flex''.
		In-flow children of a flex container are called <dfn export title="flex item" id="flex-item">flex items</dfn>
		and are laid out using the flex layout model.

	<p>
		Unlike block and inline layout,
		whose layout calculations are biased to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#abstract-box">block and inline flow directions</a>,
		flex layout is biased to the <dfn title="flex direction">flex directions</dfn>.
		To make it easier to talk about flex layout,
		this section defines a set of flex flow&ndash;relative terms.
		The 'flex-flow' value determines how these terms map
		to physical directions (top/right/bottom/left),
		axes (vertical/horizontal), and sizes (width/height).

	<figure>

	</figure>

	<dl id="main" export>
		<dt class='axis'>main axis
		<dt class='axis'>main dimension
		<dd>
			The <dfn title="main axis|main-axis">main axis</dfn> of a flex container is the primary axis along which <i>flex items</i> are laid out.
			It extends in the <dfn>main dimension</dfn>.

		<dt class='side'>main-start
		<dt class='side'>main-end
		<dd>
			The <i>flex items</i> are placed within the container
			starting on the <dfn>main-start</dfn> side
			and going toward the <dfn>main-end</dfn> side.

		<dt class='size'>main size
		<dt class='size'>main size property
		<dd>
			A <i>flex item</i>’s width or height,
			whichever is in the <i>main dimension</i>,
			is the item's <dfn>main size</dfn>.
			The <i>flex item</i>’s <dfn>main size property</dfn> is
			either the 'width' or 'height' property,
			whichever is in the <i>main dimension</i>.
	</dl>

	<dl id="cross" export>
		<dt class='axis'>cross axis
		<dt class='axis'>cross dimension
		<dd>
			The axis perpendicular to the <i>main axis</i> is called the <dfn title="cross axis|cross-axis">cross axis</dfn>.
			It extends in the <dfn>cross dimension</dfn>.

		<dt class='side'>cross-start
		<dt class='side'>cross-end
		<dd>
			<i>Flex lines</i> are filled with items and placed into the container
			starting on the <dfn>cross-start</dfn> side of the flex container
			and going toward the <dfn>cross-end</dfn> side.

		<dt class='size'>cross size
		<dt class='size'>cross size property
		<dd>
			The width or height of a <i>flex item</i>,
			whichever is in the <i>cross dimension</i>,
			is the item's <dfn>cross size</dfn>.
			The <dfn>cross size property</dfn> is
			whichever of 'width' or 'height' that is in the <i>cross dimension</i>.

<h2 id='flex-containers'>
Flex Containers: the ''flex'' and ''inline-flex'' 'display' values</h2>

	<pre class="propdef">
	Name: display
	New values: flex | inline-flex
	</pre>

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=display>
		<dt><dfn>flex</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate a block-level <i>flex container</i> box.

		<dt><dfn>inline-flex</dfn>
		<dd>
			This value causes an element to generate an inline-level <i>flex container</i> box.
	</dl>

	<p>
		A <i>flex container</i> establishes a new <dfn export>flex formatting context</dfn> for its contents.
		This is the same as establishing a block formatting context,
		except that flex layout is used instead of block layout:
		floats do not intrude into the flex container,
		and the flex container's margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents.
		<i>Flex containers</i> form a containing block for their contents
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html#containing-block-details">exactly like block containers do</a>. [[!CSS21]]
		The 'overflow' property applies to <i>flex containers</i>.


	<p>
		Flex containers are not block containers,
		and so some properties that were designed with the assumption of block layout don't apply in the context of flex layout.
		In particular:

	<ul>
		<li>
			all of the 'column-*' properties in the Multicol module have no effect on a flex container.

		<li>
			'float' and 'clear' have no effect on a <i>flex item</i>,
			and do not take it out-of-flow.
			However, the 'float' property can still affect box generation
			by influencing the 'display' property's computed value.

		<li>
			'vertical-align' has no effect on a flex item.

		<li>
			the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements do not apply to <i>flex containers</i>.
	</ul>

	<p>
		If an element's specified 'display' is ''inline-flex'',
		then its 'display' property computes to ''flex''
		in certain circumstances:
		the table in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#dis-pos-flo">CSS 2.1 Section 9.7</a>
		is amended to contain an additional row,
		with ''inline-flex'' in the "Specified Value" column
		and ''flex'' in the "Computed Value" column.

<h2 id='flex-items'>
Flex Items</h2>

	Loosely speaking, the <a>flex items</a> of a <a>flex container</a>
	are the in-flow boxes generated from the contents
	of the element that generated the <a>flex container</a>.

	<p>
		Each in-flow child of a <i>flex container</i>
		becomes a <i>flex item</i>,
		and each contiguous run of text that is directly contained inside a <i>flex container</i>
		is wrapped in an anonymous <i>flex item</i>.
		However, an anonymous flex item that contains only
		<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#white-space-prop">white space</a>
		(i.e. characters that can be affected by the 'white-space' property)
		is not rendered, as if it were ''display:none''.

	<p>
		A <i>flex item</i> establishes a new formatting context for its contents.
		The type of this formatting context is determined by its 'display' value, as usual.
		However, flex items themselves are flex-level boxes, not block-level boxes:
		they participate in their container's flex formatting context,
		not in a block formatting context.

	<div class="example">
		<p>Examples of flex items:
		<pre>
&lt;div style="display:flex">

    &lt;!-- flex item: block child -->
    &lt;div id="item1">block&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- flex item: floated element; floating is ignored -->
    &lt;div id="item2" style="float: left;">float&lt;/div>

    &lt;!-- flex item: anonymous block box around inline content -->
    anonymous item 3

    &lt;!-- flex item: inline child -->
    &lt;span>
        item 4
        &lt;!-- flex items do not split around blocks -->
        &lt;div id=not-an-item>item 4&lt;/div>
        item 4
    &lt;/span>
&lt;/div></pre>
	</div>

	<p class="note">
		Authors reading this spec may want to
		<a href="#item-margins">skip past the following box-generation details</a>.

	If the specified 'display-outside' of an in-flow child of an element that generates a <a>flex container</a>
	is ''inline-level'',
	it computes to ''block-level''.
	(This effectively converts any inline 'display' values to their block equivalents.)

	Note: Some values of 'display-outside' trigger the creation of anonymous boxes around the original box.
	It's the outermost box, the direct child of the <a>flex container</a> box,
	that becomes a <a>flex item</a>.
	For example, given two contiguous child elements with ''display:table-cell'',
	an anonymous table wrapper box around them becomes the <i>flex item</i>.

	<p id="table-items">
		On a flex item with ''display: table'', the table wrapper box becomes the <i>flex item</i>,
		and the 'order' and 'align-self' properties apply to it.
		The contents of any caption boxes contribute to the calculation of
		the table wrapper box's min-content and max-content sizes.
		However, like 'width' and 'height', the 'flex' longhands apply to the table box as follows:
		the <i>flex item</i>’s final size is calculated
		by performing layout as if the distance between
		the table wrapper box's edges and the table box's content edges
		were all part of the table box's border+padding area,
		and the table box were the <i>flex item</i>.

<h3 id='abspos-items'>
Absolutely-Positioned Flex Children</h3>

	An absolutely-positioned child of a <i>flex container</i> does not participate in flex layout
	beyond the <a href="#algo-flex-order">reordering step</a>.

	Issue: This section is worded badly,
	because 2.1 is incoherent about what "static position" really is.

	The static position of an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a>
	is determined such that the child is positioned
	as if it were the sole <a>flex item</a> in the <a>flex container</a>,
	assuming both the child and the flex container
	were fixed-size boxes of their used size.

	In other words,
	if the static position were conceived of as a point to which the absolutely-positioned element is aligned,
	the static position of an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a>
	is determined by the alignment properties set on the <a>flex container</a> and the child
	as if it were a zero-height, zero-width only-child in-flow flex item.
	Furthermore, the absolutely-positioned child aligns itself in the given axis
	to the static position in the same way:

	<dl>

		<dt>In the <a>main axis</a>
		<dd>
			If the <a>flex container's</a> 'justify-content' value
			would align a single <a>flex item</a>
			to the start, center, or end side of the <a>main axis</a>,
			the static position in the <a>main axis</a> is the start, center, or end of the flex container's content box, respectively,
			and the absolutely-positioned box aligns its outer start, center, or end to the static position point, respectively.

		<dt>In the <a>cross axis</a>
		<dd>
			If the child's 'align-self' value,
			if specified on a hypothetical single <a>flex item</a> child of the <a>flex container</a>,
			would align that hypothetical child to the start, center, or end side of the <a>cross axis</a>,
			the static position in the <a>cross axis</a> is the start, center, or end of the flex container's content box, respectively,
			and the absolutely-positioned box aligns its outer start, center, or end to the static position point, respectively.
	</dl>

	<div class='example'>
		The effect of this is that if you set, for example,
		''align-content: center;'' on an absolutely-positioned child of a <a>flex container</a>,
		the child will be centered in the <a>flex container's</a> <a>cross axis</a>.
		(The static position will be in the center of the <a>cross axis</a>,
		and the child will align its center with the static position.)
	</div>

<h3 id='item-margins'>
Flex Item Margins and Paddings</h3>

	<p>
		The margins of adjacent <i>flex items</i> do not collapse.
		Auto margins absorb extra space in the corresponding dimension and can be used for alignment
		and to push adjacent flex items apart;
		see <a href="#auto-margins">Aligning with <span class=css>auto</span> margins</a>.

	<p>
		Percentage margins and paddings on <i>flex items</i> are always resolved against their respective dimensions;
		unlike blocks, they do not always resolve against the inline dimension of their containing block.

<h3 id='painting'>
Flex Item Z-Ordering</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Flex items</i> paint exactly the same as inline blocks [[!CSS21]],
		except that 'order'-modified document order is used in place of raw document order,
		and 'z-index'
		values other than ''z-index/auto'' create a stacking context
		even if 'position' is ''static''.

	<p class="note">
		Note: Descendants that are positioned outside a flex item still participate
		in any stacking context established by the flex item.

<h3 id='visibility-collapse'>
Collapsed Items</h3>

	<p>
		Specifying ''visibility:collapse'' on a flex item
		causes it to become a <dfn title="collapsed flex item|collapsed">collapsed flex item</dfn>,
		producing an effect similar to ''visibility:collapse'' on a table-row or table-column:
		the collapsed flex item is removed from rendering entirely,
		but leaves behind a "strut" that keeps the flex line's cross-size stable.
		Thus, if a flex container has only one flex line,
		dynamically collapsing or uncollapsing items
		is guaranteed to have no effect on the flex container's <i>cross size</i>
		and won't cause the rest of the page's layout to "wobble".
		Flex line wrapping <em>is</em> re-done after collapsing, however,
		so the cross-size of a flex container with multiple lines might or might not change.

	<p>
		Though collapsed flex items aren't rendered,
		they do appear in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/intro.html#formatting-structure">formatting structure</a>.
		Therefore, unlike on ''display:none'' items [[!CSS21]],
		effects that depend on a box appearing in the formatting structure
		(like incrementing counters or running animations and transitions)
		still operate on collapsed items.

	<div class="example">
		<p>In the following example,
		a sidebar is sized to fit its content.
		''visibility: collapse'' is used to dynamically hide parts of a navigation sidebar
		without affecting its width, even though the widest item (&ldquo;Architecture&rdquo;)
		is in a collapsed section.

	<p>
		To compute the size of the strut, flex layout is first performed with all items uncollapsed,
		and then re-run with each collapsed item replaced by a strut that maintains
		the original cross-size of the item's original line.
		See the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a>
		for the normative definition of how ''visibility:collapse''
		interacts with flex layout.

	<p class='note'>
		Note that using ''visibility:collapse'' on any flex items
		will cause the flex layout algorithm to repeat partway through,
		re-running the most expensive steps.
		It's recommended that authors continue to use ''display:none'' to hide items
		if the items will not be dynamically collapsed and uncollapsed,
		as that is more efficient for the layout engine.
		(Since only part of the steps need to be repeated when 'visibility' is changed,
		however, 'visibility: collapse' is still recommended for dynamic cases.)

<h3 id="min-size-auto">
Implied Minimum Size of Flex Items</h3>

	To provide a more reasonable default minimum size for <a>flex items</a>,
	this specification introduces a new ''min-width/auto'' value
	as the initial value of the 'min-width' and 'min-height' properties defined in CSS 2.1. [[!CSS21]]

	<pre class="propdef partial">
	Name: min-width, min-height
	New values: auto
	New initial value: auto
	New computed value: the percentage as specified or the absolute length or a keyword
	</pre>

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="min-width min-height">
		<dt><dfn>auto</dfn>
		<dd>
			On a <a>flex item</a> whose 'overflow' is ''overflow/visible'' in the <a>main axis</a>,
			when specified on the <a>flex item's</a> main-axis min-size property,
			this keyword specifies as the minimum size the smallest of:

			<ul>
				<li>the used 'flex-basis', if the computed 'flex-basis' was ''flex-basis/main-size'',
				<li>the computed 'max-width' ('max-height'), if that value is <a>definite</a>,
				<li>if the item has no intrinsic aspect ratio, its <a>min-content size</a>,
				<li>if the item has an intrinsic aspect ratio,
				    the width (height) calculated from
				    the aspect ratio and any definite size constraints in the opposite dimension
				    <span class="issue">Audit this for correctness.</span>
			</ul>

			Otherwise,
			this keyword computes to ''0''
			(unless otherwise defined by a future specification).
	</dl>

	<div class="note" id="min-size-opt">
		<p>
			Note that while a content-based minimum size is often appropriate,
			and helps prevent content from overlapping or spilling outside its container,
			in some cases it is not:

		<p>
			In particular, if flex sizing is being used for a major content area of a document,
			it is better to set an explicit font-relative minimum width such as ''min-width: 12em''.
			A content-based minimum width could result in a large table or large image
			stretching the size of the entire content area into an overflow zone,
			and thereby making lines of text gratuitously long and hard to read.

		<p>
			Note also, when content-based sizing is used on an item with large amounts of content,
			the layout engine must traverse all of this content before finding its minimum size,
			whereas if the author sets an explicit minimum, this is not necessary.
			(For items with small amounts of content, however,
			this traversal is trivial and therefore not a performance concern.)
	</div>


<h2 id="flow-order">
Ordering and Orientation</h2>

	<p>
		The contents of a flex container can be laid out in any direction and in any order.
		This allows an author to trivially achieve effects that would previously have required complex or fragile methods,
		such as hacks using the 'float' and 'clear' properties.
		This functionality is exposed through the 'flex-direction', 'flex-wrap', and 'order' properties.

	<p class="note">
		The reordering capabilities of flex layout intentionally affect
		<em>only the visual rendering</em>,
		leaving speech order and navigation based on the source order.
		This allows authors to manipulate the visual presentation
		while leaving the source order intact for non-CSS UAs and for
		linear models such as speech and sequential navigation.
		See <a href="#order-accessibility">Reordering and Accessibility</a>
		and the <a href="#overview">Flex Layout Overview</a> for examples
		that use this dichotomy to improve accessibility.

	<p>
		Authors <em>must not</em> use 'order' or the ''*-reverse'' values of 'flex-flow'/'flex-direction'
		as a substitute for correct source ordering,
		as that can ruin the accessibility of the document.

Display Order: the 'order' property</h3>

	<p>
		<i>Flex items</i> are, by default, displayed and laid out in the same order as they appear in the source document.
		The 'order' property can be used to change this ordering.

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: order
	Value: <<integer>>
	Initial: 0
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a> and absolutely-positioned children of <a>flex containers</a>
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: specified value
	Media: visual
	Animatable: yes
	</pre>

	<p>
		The 'order' property controls the order in which flex items appear within their flex container,
		by assigning them to ordinal groups.
		It takes a single <dfn value for=order><<integer>></dfn> value,
		which specifies which ordinal group the <a>flex item</a> belongs to.

	<p>
		A flex container lays out its content in <dfn export>order-modified document order</dfn>,
		starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and going up.
		Items with the same ordinal group are laid out in the order they appear in the source document.
		This also affects the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/zindex.html">painting order</a> [[!CSS21]],
		exactly as if the flex items were reordered in the source document.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>The following figure shows a simple tabbed interface, where the tab for the active pane is always first:

		<div class='figure'><img src="images/flex-order-example.png" alt></div>

		<p>This could be implemented with the following CSS (showing only the relevant code):

		<pre>
.tabs {
	display: flex;
}
.tabs > * {
	min-width: min-content;
	/* Prevent tabs from getting too small for their content. */
}
.tabs > .current {
	order: -1; /* Lower than the default of 0 */
}</pre>

	</div>

	<p>
		Unless otherwise specified by a future specification,
		this property has no effect on boxes that are not <i>flex items</i>.

<h4 id="order-accessibility">
Reordering and Accessibility</h4>

	<p>
		The 'order' property <em>does not</em> affect ordering in non-visual media
		(such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-speech/">speech</a>).
		Likewise, 'order' does not affect
		the default traversal order of sequential navigation modes
		(such as cycling through links, see e.g. 'nav-index' [[CSS3UI]] or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/interact/forms.html#adef-tabindex"><code>tabindex</code></a> [[HTML40]]).
		Authors <em>must</em> use 'order' only for visual, not logical, reordering of content;
		style sheets that use 'order' to perform logical reordering are non-conforming.

	<p class='note'>
		This is so that non-visual media and non-CSS UAs,
		which typically present content linearly,
		can rely on a logical source order,
		while 'order' is used to tailor the visual order.
		(Since visual perception is two-dimensional and non-linear,
		the desired visual order is not always logical.)

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Many web pages have a similar shape in the markup,
			with a header on top,
			a footer on bottom,
			and then a content area and one or two additional columns in the middle.
			Generally,
			it's desirable that the content come first in the page's source code,
			before the additional columns.
			However, this makes many common designs,
			such as simply having the additional columns on the left and the content area on the right,
			difficult to achieve.
			This has been addressed in many ways over the years,
			often going by the name "Holy Grail Layout" when there are two additional columns.
			'order' makes this trivial.
			For example, take the following sketch of a page's code and desired layout:

		<div class='code-and-figure'>
			<div><pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;header>...&lt;/header>
&lt;div id='main'>
   &lt;article>...&lt;/article>
   &lt;nav>...&lt;/nav>
   &lt;aside>...&lt;/aside>
&lt;/div>
&lt;footer>...&lt;/footer></pre></div>
			<div><img src="images/flex-order-page.svg" width=400 height=360 alt="In this page the header is at the top and the footer at the bottom, but the article is in the center, flanked by the nav on the right and the aside on the left."></div>
		</div>

		<p>
			This layout can be easily achieved with flex layout:

		<pre>
#main { display: flex; }
#main > article { order: 2; min-width: 12em; flex:1; }
#main > nav     { order: 1; width: 200px; }
#main > aside   { order: 3; width: 200px; }</pre>

		<p>
			As an added bonus,
			the columns will all be <a href="#valuedef-stretch0">equal-height</a> by default,
			and the main content will be as wide as necessary to fill the screen.
			Additionally,
			this can then be combined with media queries to switch to an all-vertical layout on narrow screens:

		<pre>
@media all and (max-width: 600px) {
	/* Too narrow to support three columns */
	#main { flex-flow: column; }
	#main > article, #main > nav, #main > aside {
		/* Return them to document order */
		order: 0; width: auto;
	}
}</pre>

		<p><small>(Further use of multi-line flex containers to achieve even more intelligent wrapping left as an exercise for the reader.)</small>
	</div>

<h2 id='flex-lines'>
Flex Lines</h2>

	<p>
		<a>Flex items</a> in a <a>flex container</a> are laid out and aligned
		within <dfn export title="flex line">flex lines</dfn>,
		hypothetical containers used for grouping and alignment by the layout algorithm.
		A flex container can be either <i>single-line</i> or <i>multi-line</i>,
		depending on the 'flex-wrap' property:
	<ul>
		<li>
			A <dfn>single-line</dfn> flex container lays out all of its children in a single line,
			even if that would cause its contents to overflow.

		<li>
			A <dfn>multi-line</dfn> flex container breaks its <i>flex items</i> across multiple lines,
			similar to how text is broken onto a new line when it gets too wide to fit on the existing line.
			When additional lines are created,
			they are stacked in the flex container along the <i>cross axis</i>
			according to the 'flex-wrap' property.
			Every line contains at least one <i>flex item</i>,
			unless the flex container itself is completely empty.
	</ul>

	<div class=example>
		<p>
			This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally.

		<pre>&lt;style>
#flex {
	display: flex;
	flex-flow: row wrap;
	width: 300px;
}
.item {
	width: 80px;
}
&lt;/style>

&lt;div id="flex">
	&lt;div class='item'>1&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='item'>2&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='item'>3&lt;/div>
	&lt;div class='item'>4&lt;/div>
&lt;/div></pre>

		<p>
			Since the container is 300px wide, only three of the items fit onto a single line.
			They take up 240px, with 60px left over of remaining space.
			Because the 'flex-flow' property specifies a <i>multi-line</i> flex container
			(due to the ''wrap'' keyword appearing in its value),
			the flex container will create an additional line to contain the last item.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/multiline-no-flex.svg">

			<figcaption>
				An example rendering of the multi-line flex container.
			</figcaption>
		</figure>
	</div>

	<p>
		Once content is broken into lines,
		each line is laid out independently;
		flexible lengths and the 'justify-content' and 'align-self' properties only consider the items on a single line at a time.

	<p>
		When a flex container has multiple lines, the <i>cross size</i> of each line
		is the minimum size necessary to contain the <i>flex items</i> on the line
		(after aligment due to 'align-self'),
		and the lines are aligned within the flex container with the 'align-content' property.
		When a flex container (even a <i>multi-line</i> one) has only one line,
		the <i>cross size</i> of the line is the <i>cross size</i> of the flex container,
		and 'align-content' has no effect.
		The <i>main size</i> of a line is always the same as the <i>main size</i> of the flex container's content box.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			Here's the same example as the previous,
			except that the flex items have all been given ''flex: auto''.
			The first line has 60px of remaining space,
			and all of the items have the same flexibility,
			so each of the three items on that line will receives 20px of extra width,
			ending up 100px wide.
			The remaining item is on a line of its own
			and will stretch to the entire width of the line, or 300px.

		<figure>
			<img src="images/multiline-flex.svg">

				A rendering of the same as above,

Flexibility</h2>

	<p>
		The defining aspect of flex layout is the ability to make the <i>flex items</i> “flex”,
		altering their width/height to fill the available space in the <i>main dimension</i>.
		This is done with the 'flex' property.
		A flex container distributes free space to its items proportional to their <i>flex grow factor</i>,
		or shrinks them to prevent overflow proportional to their <i>flex shrink factor</i>.

<h3 id='flex-common'>
Common Values of 'flex'</h3>

	<p><em>This section is informative.</em>

	<p>
		The list below summarizes the effects of the most common 'flex' values:

	<dl>
		<dt id="flex-initial">''flex: 0 main-size''
		<dt>''flex: initial''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 0 1 main-size''. (This is the initial value.)
			Sizes the item based on the 'width'/'height' properties.
			(If the item's <i>main size property</i> computes to <a value for=width>auto</a>,
			this will size the flex item based on its contents.)
			Makes the flex item inflexible when there is positive free space,
			but allows it to shrink to its min-size when there is insufficient space.
			The <a href="#alignment">alignment abilities</a> or <a href="#auto-margins"><span class=css>auto</span> margins</a>
			can be used to align flex items along the <i>main axis</i>.

		<dt>''flex: auto''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 1 1 main-size''.
			Sizes the item based on the 'width'/'height' properties,
			but makes them fully flexible, so that they absorb any free space along the <i>main axis</i>.
			If all items are either ''flex: auto'', ''flex: initial'', or ''flex: none'',
			any positive free space after the items have been sized will be distributed evenly to the items with ''flex: auto''.

		<dt>''flex: none''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: 0 0 main-size''.
			This value sizes the item according to the 'width'/'height' properties,
			but makes the flex item fully inflexible.
			This is similar to ''initial'',
			except that flex items are not allowed to shrink,
			even in overflow situations.

		<dt>''flex: &lt;positive-number>''
		<dd>
			Equivalent to ''flex: &lt;positive-number> 1 0%''.
			Makes the flex item flexible and sets the <i>flex basis</i> to zero,
			resulting in an item that receives the specified proportion of the free space in the flex container.
			If all items in the flex container use this pattern,
			their sizes will be proportional to the specified flex factor.
	</dl>

	<p>
		By default, flex items won't shrink below their minimum content size
		(the length of the longest word or fixed-size element).
		To change this, set the 'min-width' or 'min-height' property.
		(See <a href="#min-size-auto">Implied Minimum Size of Flex Items</a>.)

<h3 id='flex-components'>
Components of Flexibility</h3>

	<p>
		Individual components of flexibility can be controlled by independent longhand properties.

	Note: Authors are encouraged to control flexibility using the 'flex' shorthand
	rather than with component properties,
	as the shorthand correctly resets any unspecified components
	to accommodate <a href="#flex-common">common uses</a>.

<h4 id='flex-grow-property'>
The 'flex-grow' property</h4>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: flex-grow
	Value: <<number>>
	Initial: 0
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>

		The 'flex-grow' property sets the <i>flex grow factor</i>
		to the provided <dfn value for=flex-grow><<number>></dfn>.
		Negative numbers are invalid.

<h4 id='flex-shrink-property'>
The 'flex-shrink' property</h4>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: flex-shrink
	Value: <<number>>
	Initial: 1

	<p>
		The 'flex-shrink' property sets the <i>flex shrink factor</i>
		to the provided <dfn value for=flex-shrink><<number>></dfn>.
		Negative numbers are invalid.

<h4 id='flex-basis-property'>
The 'flex-basis' property</h4>

	<pre class='propdef'>
	Name: flex-basis
	Value: main-size | <<'width'>>
	Initial: main-size
	Applies to: <a>flex items</a>
	Inherited: no
	Computed value: as specified, with lengths made absolute
	Percentages: relative to the <a>flex container's</a> inner <i>main size</i>

	Note: Authors are encouraged to control flexibility using the 'flex' shorthand
	rather than with component properties,
	as the shorthand correctly resets any unspecified components
	to accommodate <a href="#flex-common">common uses</a>.

	<p>
		The 'flex-basis' property sets the <i>flex basis</i>.
		It accepts the same values as the 'width' and 'height' property.

	<p>
		The <dfn value for=flex-basis>main-size</dfn> keyword, when specified on a <i>flex item</i>,
		retrieves the value of the <i>main size property</i>.

	Issue: This value was originally named "auto",
	but that was confusing

	<p>
		The <i>flex basis</i> is resolved the same way as 'width' in horizontal writing modes [[!CSS21]]:
		percentage values of 'flex-basis' are resolved against
		the flex item's containing block, i.e. its flex container,
		and if that containing block's size is <a>indefinite</a>,
		the result is the same as a <i>main size</i> of <a value for=width>auto</a>.
		Similarly, 'flex-basis' determines the size of the content box,
		unless otherwise specified
		such as by 'box-sizing' [[CSS3UI]].

<h2 id='alignment'>
Alignment</h2>

	<p>
		After a flex container's contents have finished their flexing
		and the dimensions of all flex items are finalized,
		they can then be aligned within the flex container.

	<p>
		The 'margin' properties can be used to align items in a manner similar to, but more powerful than, what margins can do in block layout.
		<i>Flex items</i> also respect the alignment properties from the Box Alignment spec,
		which allow easy keyword-based alignment of items in both the <i>main axis</i> and <i>cross axis</i>.
		These properties make many common types of alignment trivial,
		including some things that were very difficult in CSS 2.1,
		like horizontal and vertical centering.

	<p class='note'>
		While the alignment properties are defined in the Box Alignment spec,
		Flexible Box Layout reproduces the definitions of the relevant ones here
		so as to not create a normative dependency that may slow down advancement of the spec.
		These properties apply only to flex layout
		until Box Alignment is finished
		and defines their effect for other layout modes.

<h3 id='auto-margins'>
Aligning with <a value for=margin>auto</a> margins</h3>

	<p>
		<em>This section is non-normative.
			The normative definition of how margins affect flex items is in the <a href="#layout-algorithm">Flex Layout Algorithm</a> section.</em>

	<p>
		Auto margins on flex items have an effect very similar to auto margins in block flow:

	<ul>
		<li>
			During calculations of flex bases and flexible lengths, auto margins are treated as ''0''.

		<li>
			Prior to alignment via 'justify-content' and 'align-self',
			any positive free space is distributed to auto margins in that dimension.

		<li>
			Overflowing boxes ignore their auto margins and overflow in the <i>end</i> direction.
	</ul>

	<p class='note'>
		Note that, if free space is distributed to auto margins,
		the alignment properties will have no effect in that dimension
		because the margins will have stolen all the free space
		left over after flexing.

	<div class='example'>
		<p>
			One use of <a value for=margin>auto</a> margins in the main axis is to separate flex items into distinct "groups".

	</pre>

	<p>
		The 'justify-content' property aligns <i>flex items</i> along the <i>main axis</i> of the current line of the flex container.
		This is done <em title=''>after</em> any flexible lengths and any <a href="#auto-margins">auto margins</a> have been resolved.
		Typically it helps distribute extra free space leftover when either
		all the <i>flex items</i> on a line are inflexible,
		or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.
		It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=justify-content>
		<dt><dfn>flex-start</dfn>
		<dd>
			<i>Flex items</i> are packed toward the start of the line.
			The <i>main-start</i> margin edge of the first <i>flex item</i> on the line

		<dt><dfn>flex-end</dfn>
		<dd>
			<i>Flex items</i> are packed toward the end of the line.
			The <i>main-end</i> margin edge of the last <i>flex item</i>

			<i>Flex items</i> are packed toward the center of the line.
			The <i>flex items</i> on the line are placed flush with each other
			and aligned in the center of the line,
			with equal amounts of empty space between the <i>main-start</i> edge of the line and the first item on the line

			<i>Flex items</i> are evenly distributed in the line.
			If the leftover free-space is negative

			<i>Flex items</i> are evenly distributed in the line,

	<p>
		<i>Flex items</i> can be aligned in the <i>cross axis</i> of the current line of the flex container,
		similar to 'justify-content' but in the perpendicular direction.
		'align-items' sets the default alignment for all of the flex container's <i title="flex items">items</i>,
		including anonymous <i>flex items</i>.
		'align-self' allows this default alignment to be overridden for individual <i>flex items</i>.
		(For anonymous flex items,
		'align-self' always matches the value of 'align-items' on their associated flex container.)

	<p>
		If either of the <i>flex item's</i> cross-axis margins are <a value for=margin>auto</a>,
		'align-self' has no effect.

	<p>
		A value of <dfn value for=align-self>auto</dfn> for 'align-self'
		computes to the value of 'align-items' on the element’s parent,
		or ''align-self/stretch'' if the element has no parent.
		The alignments are defined as:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="align-items align-self">

			The <i>flex item</i>’s margin box is centered in the <i>cross axis</i> within the line.

	</pre>

	<p>
		The 'align-content' property aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container

		similar to how 'justify-content' aligns individual items within the <i>main-axis</i>.
		Note, this property has no effect when the flex container has only a single line.
		Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for=align-content>
		<dt><dfn>flex-start</dfn>
		<dd>
			Lines are packed toward the start of the flex container.
			The <i>cross-start</i> edge of the first line in the flex container

			and each subsequent line is placed flush with the preceding line.

		<dt><dfn>flex-end</dfn>
		<dd>
			Lines are packed toward the end of the flex container.
			The <i>cross-end</i> edge of the last line
			is placed flush with the <i>cross-end</i> edge of the flex container,
			and each preceding line is placed flush with the subsequent line.

		<dt><dfn>center</dfn>
		<dd>
			Lines are packed toward the center of the flex container.
			The lines in the flex container are placed flush with each other
			and aligned in the center of the flex container,
			with equal amounts of empty space
			between the <i>cross-start</i> content edge of the flex container
			and the first line in the flex container,
			and between the <i>cross-end</i> content edge of the flex container
			and the last line in the flex container.
			(If the leftover free-space is negative,
			the lines will overflow equally in both directions.)

		<dt><dfn>space-between</dfn>
		<dd>
			Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container.
			If the leftover free-space is negative
			this value is identical to <a value for=align-content>flex-start</a>.

		<dt><dfn>space-around</dfn>
		<dd>
			Lines are evenly distributed in the flex container,

	<p class='note'>
		Note: Only flex containers with multiple lines

Flex Baselines</h3>

	<p>
		The baselines of a flex container are determined as follows (after reordering with 'order'):

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn export>main-axis baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If any of the <i>flex items</i> on the flex container's first line
					<a href="#baseline-participation">participate in baseline alignment</a>,

					Otherwise, if the flex container has at least one <i>flex item</i>,
					and its first <i>flex item</i> has a baseline
					parallel to the flex container's <i>main axis</i>,
					the flex container's <i>main-axis baseline</i> is that baseline.

				<li>
					Otherwise, the flex container's <i>main-axis baseline</i> is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-writing-modes/#inline-alignment">synthesized</a>
					from the first item's content box,
					or, failing that, from the flex container's content box.

					<!--
						Logic behind this choice (because it's different than other baseline calculations):
						If a flexbox has content, the baseline will definitely be inside the flexbox's content box.
						Thus, using the *flexbox's* content box keeps this fairly consistent -
						you don't suddenly jump outside the content box when you delete the last bit of content.
					-->
			</ol>

		<dt><dfn export>cross-axis baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If the flex container has at least one <i>flex item</i>,

			</ol>
	</dl>

	<p>
		When calculating the baseline according to the above rules,
		if the box contributing a baseline has an 'overflow' value that allows scrolling,
		the box must be treated as being in its initial scroll position
		for the purpose of determining its baseline.

	<p>
		When <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#height-layout">determining the baseline of a table cell</a>,
		a flex container provides a baseline just as a line box or table-row does. [[!CSS21]]

<h2 id='layout-algorithm'>
Flex Layout Algorithm</h2>

	This section contains normative algorithms
	detailing the exact layout behavior of a flex container and its contents.
	The algorithms here are written to optimize readability and theoretical simplicity,
	and may not necessarily be the most efficient.
	Implementations may use whatever actual algorithms they wish,
	but must produce the same results as the algorithms described here.

	Note: This section is mainly intended for implementors.
	Authors writing web pages should generally be served well by the individual property descriptions,
	and do not need to read this section unless they have a deep-seated urge to understand arcane details of CSS layout.

	For the purposes of these definitions,
	a <dfn title="definite|definite size">definite size</dfn> is one that can be determined without measuring content,
	i.e. is a <var>&lt;length></var>,
	a size of the initial containing block,
	or a <var>&lt;percentage></var> that is resolved against a definite size.
	An <dfn title="indefinite|indefinite size">indefinite size</dfn> is one that is not <i>definite</i>.


	As a special case for handling <a>stretched</a> <i>flex items</i>,
	if a <i>single-line</i> <i>flex container</i> has a definite cross size,
	the outer <i>cross size</i> of any <a>stretched</a> <i>flex items</i>
	is the flex container's inner cross size (clamped to the <i>flex item</i>’s min and max <i>cross size</i>)
	and is considered <i>definite</i>.

	The following sections define the algorithm for laying out a flex container and its contents.

<h3 id='box-manip'>
Initial Setup</h3>

	<ol start=0>
		<li id='algo-anon-box'>
			<strong>Generate anonymous flex items</strong>
			as described in the <a href="#flex-items">Flex Items</a> section.

		<li id='algo-flex-order'>
			<strong>Re-order the flex items and absolutely positioned flex container children according to their 'order'.</strong>
			The flex items with the lowest (most negative) 'order' values are first in the ordering.
			If multiple flex items share an 'order' value,
			they're ordered by document order.
			This effectively changes the order of their boxes in the box-tree,
			and how the rest of this algorithm deals with the generated flex items.
	</ol>

<h3 id='line-sizing'>
Line Length Determination</h3>

	<ol class=continue>
		<li id='algo-available'>
			<strong>Determine the available main and cross space for the flex items.</strong>
			For each dimension,
			if that dimension of the <i>flex container</i>’s content box is a <i>definite size</i>, use that;
			otherwise, subtract the <i>flex container</i>’s margin, border, and padding
			from the space available to the flex container in that dimension
			and use that value.
			<span class='note'>This might result in an infinite value.</span>
			<!-- Maybe???
			For this purpose,
			the block axis of a block container(?)
			always provides infinite available space.

<h2 id="pagination">
Fragmenting Flex Layout</h2>

	<p>
		Flex containers can break across pages
		between items,
		between lines of items (in <i>multi-line</i> mode),
		and inside items.
		The <a property title="break-before">break-*</a> properties apply to flex containers as normal for block-level or inline-level boxes.
		This section defines how they apply to flex items
		and the contents of flex items.

	<p>
		The following breaking rules refer to the fragmentation container as the “page”.
		The same rules apply to any other fragmenters.
		(Substitute “page” with the appropriate fragmenter type as needed.)
		See the CSS3 Fragmentation Module [[!CSS3-BREAK]].
		For readability, in this section the terms "row" and "column" refer to the relative orientation
		of the flex container with respect to the block flow direction of the fragmentation context,
		rather than to that of the flex container itself.

	<p>
		The exact layout of a fragmented flex container is not defined in this level of Flexible Box Layout.
		However, breaks inside a flex container are subject to the following rules:

	<ul>
		<li>
			In a row flex container,
			the 'break-before' and 'break-after' properties on flex items
			are propagated to the flex line.
			The 'break-before' property on the first line
			and the 'break-after' property on the last line
			are propagated to the flex container.

		<li>
			In a column flex container,
			the 'break-before' property on the first item
			and the 'break-after' property on the last item
			are propagated to the flex container.
			Forced breaks on other items are applied to the item itself.

		<li>
			A forced break inside a flex item effectively increases the size of its contents;
			it does not trigger a forced break inside sibling items.

		<li>
			In a row flex container,
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#btw-blocks">Class A break opportunities</a> occur between sibling flex lines,
			and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#end-block">Class C break opportunities</a> occur between the first/last flex line and the flex container's content edges.
			In a column flex container,
			<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#btw-blocks">Class A break opportunities</a> occur between sibling flex items,
			and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-break/#end-block">Class C break opportunities</a> occur between the first/last flex items on a line and the flex container's content edges.
			[[!CSS3-BREAK]]

		<li>
			When a flex container is continued after a break,
			the space available to its <i>flex items</i>
			(in the block flow direction of the fragmentation context)
			is reduced by the space consumed by flex container fragments on previous pages.
			The space consumed by a flex container fragment is
			the size of its content box on that page.
			If as a result of this adjustment the available space becomes negative,
			it is set to zero.

		<li>
			If the first fragment of the flex container is not at the top of the page,
			and some of its flex items don't fit in the remaining space on the page,
			the entire fragment is moved to the next page.

		<li>
			When a <i>multi-line</i> colum flex container breaks,

Sample Flex Fragmentation Algorithm</h3>

	<p>
		This informative section presents a possible fragmentation algorithm for flex containers.
		Implementors are encouraged to improve on this algorithm and <a href='#status'>provide feedback to the CSS Working Group</a>.

<div class='example'>

	<p class='note'>
		This algorithm assumes that pagination always proceeds only in the forward direction;
		therefore, in the algorithms below, alignment is mostly ignored prior to pagination.
		Advanced layout engines may be able to honor alignment across fragments.

	<dl>
		<dt><i>Single-line</i> column flex container
		<dd>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Run the flex layout algorithm (without regards to pagination)
					through <a href="#cross-sizing">Cross Sizing Determination</a>.

				<li>
					Lay out as many consecutive flex items or item fragments as possible
					(but at least one or a fragment thereof),
					starting from the first,
					until there is no more room on the page
					or a forced break is encountered.

				<li>
					If the previous step ran out of room
					and the free space is positive,
					the UA may reduce the distributed free space on this page
					(down to, but not past, zero)
					in order to make room for the next unbreakable flex item or fragment.
					Otherwise,
					the item or fragment that does not fit is pushed to the next page.
					The UA should pull up if more than 50% of the fragment would have fit in the remaining space
					and should push otherwise.

				<li>
					If there are any flex items or fragments not laid out by the previous steps,
					rerun the flex layout algorithm
					from <a href="#line-sizing">Line Length Determination</a>
					through <a href="#cross-sizing">Cross Sizing Determination</a>
					with the next page's size
					and <em>all</em> the contents (including those already laid out),
					and return to the previous step,
					but starting from the first item or fragment not already laid out.

				<li>
					For each fragment of the flex container,
					continue the flex layout algorithm
					from <a href="#main-alignment">Main-Axis Alignment</a>
					to its finish.
			</ol>

			<p class="note">
				It is the intent of this algorithm that column-direction <i>single-line</i> flex containers
				paginate very similarly to block flow.
				As a test of the intent,
				a flex container with ''justify-content:start''

				should paginate identically to

				same used size and same used margins.

Changes since the 18 September 2012 Candidate Recommendation</h3>

	The following significant changes were made since the

	<ul>
		<li id="change-2012-flex-grow-animation">
			Removed the restriction on animating between 0 and non-0 values in 'flex-grow' and 'flex-shrink',
			as the layout algo no longer has a discontinuity in behavior there.

		<li id="change-2012-min-width">
			Changed the behavior of the new ''min-width/auto'' initial value of 'min-width'/'min-height' to
			<ul>
				<li>Take into account whether 'overflow' is ''visible'',
					since when 'overflow' is explicitly handled, it is confusing (and unnecessary)
					to force enough size to show all the content.
				<li>Take into account the specified 'width'/'height',
					so that the implied minimum is never greater than the specified size.
				<li>Compute to itself (not to ''min-content'') on flex items,
					since they are no longer equivalent (due to above changes).

		<li id="clarify-2012-table-anon-boxes">
			Clarified that table anonymous box generation occurs
			in place of computed value conversion for internal table elements.
		<li id="clarify-2012-display-blockification">
			Clarified interaction of flex item determination with 'display-inside' / 'display-outside'
			(the new longhands of 'display' defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-display/">CSS Display Module Level 3</a>).
			<blockquote>
				<ins><p>If the specified 'display-outside' of an in-flow child of an element that generates a <a>flex container</a>

			</blockquote>
		<li id="clarify-2012-overflow-flex-containers">
			Clarified that 'overflow' applies to flex containers.
		<li id="clarify-2012-first-line-letter">
			Clarified that ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements
			do not apply to flex containers (because they are not block containers).
		<li id="clarify-2012-stretch-computed-auto">
			Clarify that <a value for=align-self>stretch</a> checks for the <em>computed</em>
			value of the cross-size property being <a value for=width>auto</a>,
			which means that percentage cross-sizes that behave as <a value for=width>auto</a>
			(because they don't resolve against definite sizes) aren't stretched.

		<li id="clarify-2012-painting-order">
			Clarified that 'order'-modified document order is used instead of raw document order when painting.

			Clarified line-breaking to precisely handle negatively-sized flex items and zero-size items at the end of a line.
