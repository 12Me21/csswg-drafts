        <h1>Long description of example illustrating floating with clear</h1>
        <p>
            This diagram illustrates the effects of floating a box ("inner") and how its "sibling" 
            is forced below it due to the 'clear' property.
        </p>
        <p>
            A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each 24px high. Text before 
            the "inner" box flows on lines 1 and halfway on line 2. The "inner" box has been floated 
            to the right and occupies the second half of lines 3 and 4. The sibling box flows on the 
            following line (line 4) and is followed by the remainder of the text.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by two lines, the second 
            beginning with the appropriate number. Vertical bars represent the left edge of the 
            floated box. The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:
        </p>
        <pre>
1 Beginning of body contents. Start

2 of outer contents.     | Inner

3                        | contents.

4 Sibling contents. End of outer

5 contents. End of body contents.
</pre>
        <p>
            The default text color is black. "Start of outer contents" is red. "Sibling contents" is 
            red. "Inner contents" is blue. "End of outer contents" is red.
