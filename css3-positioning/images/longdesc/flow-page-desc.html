        <h1>Long description for example illustrating page positioning</h1>
        <p>This diagram illustrates the effects of page positioning a box.</p>
        <p>
            A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each 24px high. All text 
            outside the "outer" box has been flowed into lines 1 and 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "outer" box is positioned absolutely so that it occupies the lower right quadrant of 
            the document window. All text in "outer" and its descendants occupies the second half of 
            lines 5 through 8.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by two lines, the second 
            beginning with the appropriate number. The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:
        </p>
