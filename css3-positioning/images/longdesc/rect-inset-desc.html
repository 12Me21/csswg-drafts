        <h1>Long description for example clipping region</h1>
        <p>
            This diagram illustrates two block boxes, one next to the other, with rectangular 
            clipping regions of similar dimensions but using the two different value functions 
            and producing the same visual result.
        </p>
        <p>
            The block boxes (generated for a P element) are identical and depicted with a dashed 
            dark gray border and a light gray background.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clipping region of the first box, demonstrating the rect() function, shows the first 
            P box lies entirely within it, offset 30% from the top edge, 25% from the left edge of 
            the P box, and 100% from the left edge (representing the right edge) and 70% from the 
            top edge (representing the bottom edge). The clipping region has a solid border and a 
            white background and is labeled "clip region".
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionaly the first box has four red arrows representing the four offsets in the 
            coresponding style rule: one short, vertical arrow labeled "30%" goes from the top edge 
            of the block box to the top of the clipping region; one longer, vertical arrow labeled 
            "70%" goes from the top of the block box to the bottom of the clipping region; one 
            short, horizontal arrow labeled "25%" goes from the left edge of the block box to the 
            left edge of the clipping region; and one long, horizontal arrow labeled "100%" that 
            goes from the left edge of the block box to the right edge of the clipping region (which 
            in this case, is also the right edge fo the block box).
        </p>
        <p>
            The clipping region of the second box, demonstrating the inset() function, shows the 
            second P box lies entirely within it, offset 30% from the top edge, 25% from the left 
            edge of the P box, and 0% from the right edge and 30% from the bottom edge. The clipping 
            region has a solid border and a white background and is labeled "clip region".
        </p>
        <p>
            The second box has three red arrows representing the three of the four offsets in the 
            coresponding style rule: one short, vertical arrow labeled "30%" goes from the top edge 
            of the block box to the top of the clipping region; one short, vertical arrow labeled 
            "30%" goes from the bottom of the block box to the bottom of the clipping region; one 
            short, horizontal arrow labeled "25%" goes from the left edge of the block box to the 
            left edge of the clipping region; and the final (right) side of the clipping region is 
            labled "0%" and is not represented by an arrow since the right edge of the block box and 
            the right edge of the clipping region are the same.
