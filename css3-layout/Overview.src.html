<p>CSS is a simple, declarative language for creating style sheets
that specify the rendering of HTML and other structured documents.
This module contains CSS features to describe layouts at a high level,
meant for tasks such as the positioning and alignment of “widgets” in
a graphical user interface or the layout grid for a page or a window.

<p>A layout grid or “template” defines one or more “slots” that an
element's content can flow into. This allows elements to have
complex shapes and it allows the visual order to be different from the
order of the elements in the source document.

<p>A '::slot' selector allows elements to be styled differently based
on which slot they appear in.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><em>(This section is not normative.)</em>

<div class=sidefigure>
  <p><img src="diagram.png" alt="Image: four elements move to four
  slots in a template" longdesc="diagram.desc">

  <p class=caption>Four regions, called a, b, c and d, each receive a
  part of a document
</div>

<p class=mtb>The styling of a Web page, a form or a graphical user
interface can roughly be divided in two parts: (1) defining the
overall “grid” of the page or window and (2) specifying the fonts,
indents, colors, etc., of the text and other objects. The two are not
completely separate, of course, because indenting or coloring a text
influences the perceived grid as well. Nevertheless, when one
separates the parts of a style that should change when the window gets
bigger from the parts that stay the same, one often finds that the
grid changes (room for a sidebar, extra navigation bar, big margins,
larger images…), while fonts, colors, indents, numbering styles, and
many other things don't have to change, until the size of the window
becomes extreme.

<p>The properties in this specification work by associating a
<em>layout policy</em> with an element. Rather than letting an element
lay out its descendants in their normal order as inline text or as
blocks of text (the policies available in CSS level&nbsp;1), the
policy defined in this module, called <em>template-based
positioning,</em> gives an element an invisible grid for aligning
descendant elements.

<p>Because layouts on the Web have to adapt to different window and
paper sizes, the rows and columns of the grid can be made fixed or
flexible in size.

<p>The typical use cases for these properties include:

<ul>
  <li>Complex Web pages, with multiple navigation bars in fixed
  positions, areas for advertisements, etc.

  <li>Complex forms, where the alignment of labels and form fields may
  be easier with the properties of this module than with the
  properties for tables and margins.

  <li>GUIs, where buttons, toolbars, labels, icons, etc., are aligned
  in complex ways and have to stay aligned (and not wrap, for example)
  when the window is resized.

  <li>Paged displays (e.g., printed media) where each page is divided
  in fixed areas for different kinds of content.

  <li>Complex pages with multiple regions, where the style of the text
  does not only depend on the type of element it comes from, but also
  on the region it is displayed in.
</ul>

<p>Template-based positioning is an alternative to absolute
positioning, which, like absolute positioning, is especially useful
for aligning elements that don't have simple relationships in the
source (parent-child, ancestor-descendant, immediate sibling). But in
contrast to absolute positioning, the elements are not positioned with
the help of horizontal and vertical coordinates, but by mapping them
into slots in a table-like template. The relative size and alignment
of elements is thus governed implicitly by the rows and columns of the
template. A template doesn't allow elements to overlap, but it provides
layouts that adapt better to different widths.

<p class=issue>Call it a “slot” or rather a “region”?

<p>The mapping is done with the 'position' property, which specifies
in this case into which slot of the template the element goes. The
template itself is specified on the 'display' property of some
ancestor of the elements to remap.

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, the four children of an element are assigned to
four slots (called a, b, c and d) in a 2×2 template. (All mark-up
examples in this specification are HTML fragments, unless otherwise
stated.)

<div class=sidefigure>
  <p><img src="aapje.png" alt="Image: sample rendering" longdesc="aapje.desc">
  <p class=caption>Each element occupies one slot. In this template,
  all slots have the same size.
</div>

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  dl { display: "ab"
                "cd" }
  #sym1 { position: a }
  #lab1 { position: b }
  #sym2 { position: c }
  #lab2 { position: d }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt id=sym1&gt;A
  &lt;dd id=lab1&gt;A is een aapje
  &lt;dt id=sym2&gt;B
  &lt;dd id=lab2&gt;B is de bakker
&lt;/dl&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Templates can also help with device-independence. This example uses
Media Queries [[MEDIAQ]] to change the overall layout of a page from
3-column layout for a wide screen to a 1-column layout for a narrow
screen. It assumes the page has been marked-up with logical sections
with IDs.

<pre>
@media all
{
  body { display: "aaa"
                  "bcd" }
  #head { position: a }
  #nav { position: b }
  #adv { position: c }
  #body { position: d }
}
@media all and (max-width: 500px)
{
  body { display: "a"
                  "b"
                  "c" }
  #head { position: a }
  #nav { position: b }
  #adv { display: none }
  #body { position: c }
}</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Elements can be positioned this way, but not made to overlap,
unless with negative margins. Here is how the <a
href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/026/026.css&amp;page=0">
“zunflower” design</a> of the Zen Garden could be done:

<pre>
#container { display: "abc" }
#intro { position: a; margin-right: -2em; box-shadow: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em }
#supportingText { position: b; box-shadow: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em }
#linkList { position: c }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Template-based positioning borrows some concepts from table layout,
in particular the idea of aligning elements in rows and columns, so
that they constrain each other's size. But there are also differences. 
This example shows some of them. Assume this document fragment:

<pre>
&lt;div class=group>
 &lt;div>aa aa aa aa aa aa&lt;/div>
 &lt;div>bbb&lt;/div>
 &lt;div class=menu>ccccc&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
</pre>

<p>We can lay it out as three columns, as the following illustrations
show. The style sheet would contain the following.

<pre>
.group {display: table}
.group > div {display: table-cell}
</pre>

<div class=figure>
  <p><img src="table1.png" alt="[Three unequal cells]" longdesc="table1.desc">

  <p class=caption>Example of rendering with a table.
</div>

<p>We can also use a template, in which case the style sheet would
contain this:

<pre>
.group {display: "abc"}
.group > div {position: a}
.group > div + div {position: b}
.group > div + div + div {position: c}
</pre>

<p>By default, the table is as wide as needed to fit its contents. To
make sure it is as wide as its containing block, we need to add

<pre>.group {display: table; width: 100%}</pre>

<p>That is not needed for the template, but, on the other hand, if we
want the template to fit its contents, we would need to say so:

<pre>.group {display: "abc"; width: fit-content}</pre>

<p>(See [[!CSS3BOX]] for the definition of the 'width' property.) The
columns of the template are by default all the same size. The columns
of the table satisfy certain constraints, but the exact size is not
defined. We can make them all the same by adding a rule (see
[[!CSS3TBL]]):

<pre>.group {display: table; width: 100%; table-layout: fixed}</pre>

<div class=figure>
  <p><img src="table2.png" alt="[Three equal cells]" longdesc="table2.desc">

  <p class=caption>Example of rendering with equal columns.
</div>

<p>In both styles, we can set a column to a certain size:

<pre>div.menu {width: 3em}</pre>

<p>resp.,

<pre>.group {display: "abc" * * 3em}</pre>

<div class=figure>
  <p><img src="table3.png" alt="[Two equal cells, third is 3em wide]"
  longdesc="table3.desc">

  <p class=caption>Example of rendering with a fixed third column and
  the other two columns of equal width.
</div>

<p>If there is an unknown number of columns (children of the div.group
element), the style sheet for the table model will automatically take
them into account. The style sheet for the template model, however,
creates a template of exactly three columns and can't handle tables
with an unknown number of columns. The extra elements will be added
into the default slot (in this case the ''a'' slot).

<p>In both models, elements can have borders, but only in the table
model can borders be collapsed, which makes setting borders a little
easier in the table model:

<pre>
.group {display: table; border-collapse: collapse}
.group > div {border: solid}
</pre>

<p>resp.,

<pre>
.group > div {border: solid; border-left: none}
.group > div:first-child {border-left: solid}
</pre>

<p>In the template model, the order of the elements is explicit, and
thus it is possible to reverse the order of the columns:

<pre>
.group > div {position: c}
.group > div + div {position: b}
.group > div + div + div {position: a}
</pre>

<div class=figure>
  <p><img src="table4.png" alt="[Different contents for the cells]"
  longdesc="table4.desc">

  <p class=caption>Example of rendering with the contents of the three
  columns reversed: the third element is shown in the first slot and
  the first element in the third slot.
</div>

<p>In the table model, the order of the rows and columns is given by
the document source and thus can't be changed.
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>This example shows a way to move notes to the end of a section. 
“Notes” in this example refers to elements in HTML with a class of 
“note”. A fragment of HTML such as
<pre>
&lt;div class=section>
  &lt;p>The balubious coster of the fifth secter&lt;span
    class=note> The sixth secter coster is a difter
    manon.&lt;/span> of The Rollow Carpug mentizes a costernica.
  &lt;p>&hellip;
&lt;/div>
</pre>
<p>with this style sheet
<pre>
div.section {
    display: "@" available
             "F" available}
.note {
    position: F;
    content: counter(note) ".\A0" contents;
    counter-increment: note;
    font-size: smaller}
.note::before {
    content: counter(note);
    position: @;
    vertical-align: super;
    font-size: larger}
</pre>
<p>results in a rendering similar to this:
<div class=figure>
<p><img src="footnotes.png" alt="Same text, with the SPAN replaced by
“(1)” and it content moved to the end." longdesc="footnotes.desc">
<p class=caption>Rendering of a text with footnotes.
</div>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>This example shows the use of chained regions: text from region 1
continues in region 2, 3 and 4. And it shows how to use
pseudo-elements to style text in a particular region: text in region 1
is bigger than in other regions.

<div class=figure>
<p><img src="regions-intro-rendering.png" alt="Image of a complex,
3-column layout" longdesc="regions-intro-rendering.desc">
<p class=caption>Example rendering
</div>

<p>We assume a document fragment similar to this:

<pre>
&lt;div id=article>
  &lt;p>&lt;img src="sunset" alt="">
  &lt;h1>Introduction&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>This is an example…
    
  &lt;h1>More Details&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>This illustrates…
  &lt;p>Then, the example…
  &lt;p>Finally, this…
&lt;/div>
</pre>

<p>The style sheet makes the DIV into a template element with five
regions, called A, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The regions are grouped into two
chains: region A on its own, and the chain consisting of 1, 2, 3 and 4.

<pre>
#article {
  display: "A A 4"
           "A A 4"
           "1 1 4"
           "2 3 4";
  chains: 1 2 3 4 }
</pre>

<p>All children go into region 1 (and continue in 2, 3 and 4 as
needed). The IMG element goes into region A. We assume for simplicity
that there is only one IMG element:

<pre>
#article > * { position: 1 }
#article img { position: A }
</pre>

<p>The text in region 1 is bolder, larger and a different color than
in the other regions. Also, an H1 that falls into this region is
rendered differently from other H1s:

<pre>
::slot(@) {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #0C3D5F;
  font-size: larger }
h1::slot(@) {
  color: crimson;
  display: run-in }
</pre>

<p>(For brevity, the example doesn't show the style rules to set the
color and background, to make the text justified, add the left border
to the second H1, etc.)
</div>

<h2>Features out of scope</h2>

<p>A number of features that are related to grid layouts are not
handled in this module. Some of them are in other modules.

<h3>Repeating templates</h3>

<p>The templates defined by this specification have a fixed number of
slots, independent of the amount of content or the number of child
elements. In some situations it may be useful to define a template and
then, in the case there is more content than fits, automatically
create new copies of the template, to the side of or below the first
one, just like new pages are created in paged media or new columns in
multi-column layouts. 

<p>In some cases it may be possible to simulate that behavior by
putting the template element inside a column layout.

<h3>Non-rectangular shapes and wrap-arounds</h3>

<p>This specification allows to chain multiple slots togother to form
complex shapes, but each of the slots is itself still rectangular.

<p>Another module, <cite>CSS exclusions and shapes</cite>
[[CSS3-EXCLUSIONS]], is expected to allow floating elements to have
non-rectangular shapes and allow positioned elements to cause
wrap-around.

<h2>Declaring templates: the 'display' property</h2>

<p class=issue><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/issues/123"
>ISSUE-123:</a> One way to experiment safely with implementations
before the specification reaches Candidate Recommendation status is to
add an identifier with a vendor prefix somewhere in the value, e.g.,
'display: -my-product "aa" "bc"' or 'display: -my-product("aa"
"bc")'.

<table class=propdef-extra>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td>'display'
    <tr>
      <td><em>New value:</em>
      <td><var>&lt;display-type&gt;</var>? && [ [ <var>&lt;string&gt;</var> [ /
      <var>&lt;row-height&gt;</var> ]? ]+ ]
      <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var>*
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>A value of this form is called a <dfn>template.</dfn>

<p>An element with such a 'display' value is
similar to a table element, in that its content is laid out in rows and
columns. The two main differences are that the number of rows and
columns doesn't depend on the content, but is fixed by the value of
the property; and that the order of the descendants in the source
document may be different from the order in which they appear in the
rendered template.

<p>The <dfn><var>&lt;display-type&gt;</var></dfn> is one of the
following keywords. An omitted keyword is equivalent to ''block''.

<pre class=prod><dfn><var>&lt;display-type&gt;</var></dfn> = inline |
block | list-item | inline-block | table | inline-table |
table-row-group | table-header-group | table-footer-group | table-row
| table-column-group | table-column | table-cell | table-caption |
none</pre>

<dl>
<dt>''inline''
<dt>''inline-block''
<dt>''inline-table''
<dd>These three values are equivalent. The element is
an <em>inline-level</em> element.

<dt>''list-item''
<dd>The element is formatted as a list item. If the element has the
value ''inside'' for its 'list-style-position', that ''inside'' is
treated as if it were ''outside''.

<dt>''block''
<dt>''table''
<dd>These two values are equivalent.

<dt>''table-row-group''
<dt>''table-header-group''
<dt>''table-footer-group''
<dd>This creates a principal block-level box that is the template,
with around it an anonymous ''table-row'' box and around it a box of
the indicated type. Around it may be more anonymous boxes according to
the rules for <a href="/TR/CSS2/tables.html#anonymous-boxes"
>Anonymous table objects</a> [[!CSS21]].

<dt>''table-row''
<dd>This creates a principal block-level box that is the template and
around it a ''table-row'' box. Around it may be zero or more anonymous
boxes according to the rules
for <a href="/TR/CSS2/tables.html#anonymous-boxes" >Anonymous table
objects</a> [[!CSS21]].

<dt>''table-column-group''
<dt>''table-column''
<dd>The template is ignored and the element is treated as an element
of the indicated type.

<dt>''table-cell''
<dd>The element is a table cell with a template.

<dt>''table-caption''
<dd>The element is a table caption with a template.

<dt>''none''
<dd>The template is ignored and the element is treated as for
'display: none'.
</dl>

<p class=issue>Future display types added in other modules?


<p class=note>Note that 'display' is extended to apply to '@page'
rules as well and that it has a different default there, viz.,
''"@"''. See <a href="#paged">“Templates in paged media”</a> below.

<!-- If display becomes a shorthand for display-model and
display-role, explain that the former gets the template (and the
latter is inline or block depending on whether the inline
keyword is present). -->

<p>Each string consist of one or more at signs (“@”), letters (or
digits, see
<var>&lt;letter&gt;</var> below), periods
(“.”) and spaces. Each string represents
one row in the template, each character other than a space represents
one column in that row. Spaces have no meaning. They may be added for
readability.

<p>The symbols in the template have the following meaning
<dl>
  <dt>a letter
    <dd>slot for content.
  <dt>@
    <dd>(at sign) default slot for content.
  <dt>.
    <dd>(period) white-space.
</dl>

<p>Multiple identical letters in adjacent rows or columns form a
single <dfn>slot</dfn> that spans those rows and columns.
Ditto for multiple “@”s. Uppercase and lowercase are considered to be
the same letter (i.e., the template is case-insensitive).

<p>Non-rectangular slots and multiple slots with the same
letter are illegal. A template without any letter or
“@” is illegal. A template with more than one “@” slot is illegal. 
These errors cause the declaration to be ignored.

<p class=note>Note: non-rectangular and disconnected regions
may be permitted in a future update of CSS.

<p>Rows with fewer columns than other rows are implicitly padded with
periods (“.”) (that will thus not contain any elements).

<p>Each slot (letter or “@”) acts as a block element for its
contents.

<p>Each <dfn><var>&lt;row-height&gt;</var></dfn> sets the
height of the preceding row. The default is ''auto''. The values can
be as follows:

<dl>
  <dt><var>&lt;length&gt;</var>

  <dd>An explicit height for that row. Negative values make the
  template illegal. If the length is expressed in ''gr'' units, these
  refer to the inherited grid, not the grid defined by the template
  itself (see <a href="#gr-unit" >“Definition of the ''gr'' unit in a
  template element”</a>).

  <dt>auto

  <dd>The row's height is determined by its contents. See the <a
  href="#rowheight">algorithm</a> below.

  <dt>*

  <dd>(asterisk) All rows with an
  asterisk will be of equal height. See the <a
  href="#rowheight">algorithm</a> below.
</dl>

<p>Each <dfn><var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var></dfn> sets the width of a
column. If there are more <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var>s then columns,
the last ones are ignored. If there are fewer, the missing ones are
assumed to be '*'. Each <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> can be one of the
following:

<dl>
  <dt><var>&lt;length&gt;</var>

  <dd>An explicit width for that column. Negative values make the
  template illegal.

  <dt>*

  <dd>(asterisk.) All columns with a '*' have
  the same width. See the <a href="#colwidth">algorithm</a> below.

  <dt>max-content,
  <dt>min-content

  <dd>The column's width is determined by its contents. See the
  <a href="#colwidth">algorithm</a> below.

  <dt>minmax(<var>p</var>,<var>q</var>)

  <dd>The column's width is constrained to be greater than or equal
  to <var>p</var> and less than or equal to <var>q</var>. <var>p</var>
  and <var>q</var> stand for [ <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> | max-content
  | min-content | * ]. There may be white space around the <var>p</var>
  and <var>q</var>. If <var>q</var> &lt; <var>p</var>,
  then <var>q</var> is ignored and
  ''minmax(<var>p</var>,<var>q</var>)'' is treated as

  <dt>fit-content

  <dd>Equivalent to 'minmax(min-content, max-content)'.

<p class=note>Note that it is legal to specify no widths at all. In
that case, all columns have the same width.

<div class=issue>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Tracker/issues/127"
>ISSUE-127:</a>
It has been suggested that the template may become too verbose in
the case of column widths that are very small factions, e.g., a column
of 1/40th of the width:
<pre>display: "abbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"</pre>
<p>Abbreviating this with percentages ('2.5% 97.5%') introduces an
opportunity for errors (e.g., '3% 98%' causes the template to be
rejected). Abbreviating with numbers,
<pre>display: "ab"  * 39*</pre>
<p>(or even just '1 39') is safer. On the other hand, those 39
identical letters make it immediately clear what the intention
is&hellip;
</div>

<p>The orientation of the template is independent of the writing mode
('direction' and 'block-flow' properties): the first string is the
topmost row and the first symbol in each string is the leftmost
column.

<div class=example>
<pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  div { display: ".aa..bb." }
  p.left { position: a }
  p.right { position: b }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p class=left&gt;Left column
  &lt;p class=right&gt;Right column
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>An element with a template value for its 'display' property
is called a <dfn>template element</dfn>. An element's <dfn>template
ancestor</dfn> is defined (recursively) as follows:
<ul>
  <li>if the element has 'position: fixed', 'position: absolute', a
  value of 'float' that is not ''none'' or the element is the root
  element, than it has no template ancestor.

  <li>else, if the element's parent has a template as its
  'display', then that parent is the element's template
  ancestor.

  <li>else, the element's template ancestor is the same as its
  parent's template ancestor.
</ul>

<h2 id=colwidth>Computing the width of the slots</h2>

<p>First, the <dfn title="intrinsic minimum width|intrinsic preferred
width">intrinsic minimum and intrinsic preferred widths</dfn> are
defined as follows:
<ul>
  <li><p>A column with a <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> of a given
  <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> has intrinsic minimum and intrinsic
  preferred widths both equal to that <var>&lt;length&gt;</var>.

  <li><p>A column with a <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> of '*' has an
  infinite intrinsic preferred width. Its intrinsic minimum width is 0.
  
  <li><p>A column with a <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> of
  ''min-content'' has an intrinsic minimum width and intrinsic
  preferred width that are both equal to the largest of the intrinsic
  minimum widths of all the slots in that column:
    <ul>
      <li>The intrinsic minimum width of a “.” is 0.

      <li>The intrinsic minimum width of a letter or “@” is 0 if
      that slot spans two or more columns; otherwise, it is the
      <em>intrinsic minimum</em> width as defined by [[!CSS3BOX]]. For
      the purpose of that definition, the slot is considered as a
      block with a 'block-flow' of ''tb'' with its contents as its
      children. <span class=issue>Should the block progression
      direction be a property?</span>
    </ul>

  <li><p>A column with a <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> of
  ''max-content'' has an intrinsic minimum width and intrinsic
  preferred width that are both equal to the largest of the intrinsic
  preferred widths of all the slots in that column:
    <ul>
      <li>The intrinsic preferred width of a “.” is 0.

      <li>The intrinsic preferred width of a letter or “@” is the
      intrinsic preferred width as defined by [[!CSS3BOX]]. For the
      purpose of that definition, the slot (which may span several
      columns) is considered as a block with a 'block-flow' of ''tb''
      with its contents as its children. <span class=issue>Should the
      block progression direction be a property?</span>
    </ul>

  <li><p>A column with a <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> of
  'minmax(<var>p</var>,<var>q</var>)' has an intrinsic minimum width
  equal to <var>p</var> and an intrinsic preferred width equal to
  <var>q</var>.
</ul>

<p>Next, the <dfn>layout algorithm</dfn> distinguishes between
elements with and without an a-priori known content width.

<p class=note>The width isn't known a-priori, if, e.g., 'width' is
''auto'' and the element is floating, absolutely positioned,
inline-block or a child of a block with vertical writing mode.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If the element has an a-priori width:
    <ul>
      <li>If the sum of the <em title="intrinsic minimum
      width">intrinsic minimum widths</em> of the columns is larger
      than the element's width, each column is set to its
      <em>intrinsic minimum width</em> and the contents will overflow
      (see 'overflow').

      <li>If the sum of the <em title="intrinsic minimum
      width">intrinsic minimum widths</em> of the columns is less than
      or equal to the element's width, the columns are widened until
      the total width is equal to the element's width, as follows: all
      columns get the same width, except that no column or span of
      columns may be wider than its <em>intrinsic preferred
      width.</em> If the columns cannot be widened enough, the
      template is left or right aligned in the element's content area,
      depending on whether 'direction' is ''ltr'' or ''rtl'',
      respectively.
    </ul>

  <li>
    <p>If the element doesn't have an a-priori width:
    <ul>
      <li>If the sum of the <em title="intrinsic minimum
      width">intrinsic minimum widths</em> of the columns is wider
      than the <em>initial containing block,</em> each column is set
      to its <em>intrinsic minimum width.</em> The element's <em>used
      width</em> is the sum of the widths of the columns.

      <li>If the sum of the <em title="intrinsic minimum
      width">intrinsic minimum widths</em> of the columns is less than
      or equal to the width of the <em>initial containing block,</em>
      the columns are widened until the total width is equal to the
      <em>initial containing block,</em> as follows: all columns get
      the same width, except that no column or span of columns may be
      wider than its <em>maximum intrinsic width.</em> The element's
      <em>used width</em> is the sum of the widths of the columns.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>An extra step may be necessary in paged media if a page break
occurs inside a template (only in the case of an <em>element-based
template,</em> see <a href="#element-based-page-break" >below</a>). If
the template, after computing the width and height, is too big to fit
on the current page, and if a suitable break point exists, the part of
the template after that break point is put on the next page. The width
of the containing block on that page may be different if that page has
different margins from the current page (see [[!CSS3PAGE]]) and thus
the width and height of that part of the template must be recalculated
in the new context.

<p class=note>Note that the widths of the columns can be completely
determined before laying out any of the contents as long as there are
no columns with a <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> of ''min-content'' or
''max-content''.

<p class=issue>Do we define restrictions or approximations for slots
that are part of a <em>chain</em> to avoid complicated optimization
algorithms?

<h2 id=rowheight>Computing the height of the slots</h2>

<p>The height of the template is the smallest possible under the
following constraints:

<ol>
  <li>Rows with a height set to <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> have that
  height.

  <li>No row has a negative height.

  <li>All rows with a height set to '*' are the same height.

  <li>Every sequence of one or more rows of which at least one has a
  height set to ''auto'' is at least as high as every letter or
  “@” slot that spans exactly that sequence of rows.

  <li>If the computed value of the element's 'height' is ''auto'',
  then every sequence of one or more rows of which at least one has a
  height set to '*' is at least as high as every letter or “@” slot
  that spans exactly that sequence of rows.

  <li>The whole template is at least as high as the computed value of
  the element's 'height', unless that value is ''auto'', or unless all
  rows have a height set to <var>&lt;length&gt;</var>.
</ol>

<p>If the template is higher than the element's 'height', the element
overflows, see 'overflow'.

<p class=issue>This may have multiple solutions in case the element
has a fixed height that is larger than the sum of the minimum sizes of
each row. Do all rows without a fixed <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> become
taller by the same amount? or by the same percentage? or do rows with
'auto' only increase if there are no rows with '*'? Something like a
box-flex-group property (and optionally a box-flex as well (see
[[CSS3-FLEXBOX]]) can give the designer explicit control. The note
below hints at that. Another option is to have ''fill'' and ''filll''
units as in T<sub>E</sub>X: calc(5em + 2fill).

<p class=note>Note: In a future update of CSS, rows might get a
property to specify how the height of that row is adjusted in case the
above calculation yields a template that is less tall than the element
itself.

<p>The height of a slot is measured as if the slot had one <dfn
title="anonymous block of a slot">anonymous block</dfn> as a child that
contains all the slot's contents, and both the slot and the anonymous
block have a 'block-flow' of ''tb'' and the anonymous
block's height is computed as a <em>flow root</em> (see “Auto heights
for flow roots” in [[!CSS3BOX]]). Roughly, this means the height is
from the top margin edge of the topmost element to the bottom margin
edge of the bottommost element or of the bottommost float.

<p>The intrinsic height of a '.' slot is 0.

<div class=example>
<p>This example divides the window in three rows and three columns,
separated by 1em of white space. The middle row and the middle column
are flexible, the others are fixed at a specific size. The first
column is 5em wide, the last one 10em.

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
  body {
    height: 100%;
    display: "a   .   b   .   c"  /2em

             ".   .   .   .   ."  /1em
             "g   .   h   .   i"  /2em
             5em 1em  *  1em 10em}

<h2 id=position>Flowing content into the template: the 'position'
property</h2>

<p class=issue>One way to experiment safely with implementations
before the specification reaches Candidate Recommendation status is to
add an identifier with a vendor prefix somewhere in the value, e.g.,
'position: a -my-product' or 'position: -my-product(a)'.

<table class=propdef-extra>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td><dfn>position</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td><em>New value:</em>
      <td><var>&lt;letter&gt;</var> | same
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>'<var>&lt;letter&gt;</var>' or ''static''; see text
</table>

<p>This value of the 'position' property specifies into which row and
column of a template the element is placed.
The <dfn>&lt;letter&gt;</dfn> must be a single letter or digit, with category
Lu, Ll, Lt or Nd in Unicode [[!UNICODE]]), or a “@” symbol.

<dl>
  <dt><var>&lt;letter&gt;</var>

  <dd>The element is taken out of the flow of its parent and put into
  the specified slot in its <em>template
  ancestor.</em> <span class=issue>[If the slot is the first of a
  chain, see 'chains', the element is put in that chain, not
  necessarily in the first slot.]</span> If there is no slot of this
  name, the computed value is ''static''. <span class=issue>[If the
  slot is part of a chain, but not the first slot in the chain, the
  computed value is likewise ''static''.]</span>

  <dt>same

  <dd>A value of ''same'' computes to the same letter as the most
  recent element with a letter as computed value that has the
  same <em>template ancestor</em>. If there is no such element, the
  value computes to ''static''.
</dl>

<p id=containing-block>The <em>containing block</em> of an element
with one of these values for 'position' is the slot in the template
into which it is flowed.

<p>Multiple elements may be put into the same slot. They will be
laid-out according to their 'display' property in the order they
occur in the source document.

<p>The content of a <em>template element</em> is put in the slot
marked with “@”s. If there is no such slot, the content is put in the
first (leftmost) slot on the first row that doesn't consist of only
“.”. <span class=issue>[If the slot is part of a <em>chain,</em>, the
content is put in that chain instead.]</span>

<div class=example>
<p>A common markup in HTML for illustrations with captions is as
follows:
<pre>
&lt;div class=figure>
 &lt;p>&lt;img src="paul.jpg" alt="...">
 &lt;p class=caption>A pond in a playground in Amsterdam
&lt;/div>
</pre>
<p>The caption can be put above the image by using a template as
follows:
<pre>
div.figure {display: "aaa"
                     ".b."
                     * min-content *}
div.figure p {position: b}
div.figure p.caption {position: a; text-align: center}
</pre>
<p>The caption can be wider than the image and the image will be
centered.

<p>When the figure is floating, it is probably better to not let the
caption become wider than the image (unless the caption cannot be made
narrow enough):
<pre>
div.figure {float: right; display: "a" "b" min-content}
div.figure p {position: b}
div.figure p.caption {position: a; text-align: center}
</pre>
</div>

<!--
<div class=example>
<p>The FIG element, that was once proposed for HTML, has an attribute
that points to an image, a CAPTION child and some fallback text. The
template below uses “@” to indicate where the image (or the fallback)
goes, in relation to the caption.

<pre>
/* &lt;FIG SRC=...&gt;&lt;CAPTION&gt;...&lt;/&gt; Fallback&lt;/&gt; */
FIG {
  /* See Generated Content Module */
  content: attr(SRC, url), normal;
  /* Caption may be wider than image */
  display: ".@."
           "xxx"
           * min-content * }
CAPTION { position: x }</pre>
</div>
-->

<div class=example>
<p>In this example, a form is laid out on a grid, with two labels and
two input boxes and a submit and a reset button:

<pre>
form {
  border: thin solid;
  display: "aaaa.bbbb"
           "........."/1em
           "cccc.dddd"
           "........."/1em
           "...ee..ff" }
label[for=minv] { position: a }
input#minv { position: b; display: block }
label[for=maxv] { position: c }
input#maxv { position: d; display: block }
input[type=submit] { position: e; display: block }
input[type=reset] { position: f; display: block }
</pre>

<p>Here is the fragment of HTML that the style is applied to:

<pre>
&lt;form action="./"&gt;
  &lt;label for=minv&gt;Enter minimum value:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id=minv name=minv&gt;
  &lt;label for=maxv&gt;Enter maximum value:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id=maxv name=maxv&gt;
  &lt;input type=submit value="OK"&gt;
  &lt;input type=reset value="Reset"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>

<p>The addition of 'display: block' causes
the form controls to use the width computation of blocks, in other
words: they will be as wide as their containing block, which in this
case means that they will be as wide as the slot they are assigned
to. Without it, they would be inline elements and just be left-aligned
in their slots.

<p class=issue>Another, more verbose syntax could be more readable for
infrequent users: 'position: slot(a)'. (But maybe harder to remember
when writing style rules?)

<h2 id=slot-pseudo>The ''::slot()'' pseudo-element</h2>

<p>The slots of a <em>template element</em> can be individually
addressed with the <dfn>''slot()'' pseudo-element.</dfn>

<div class=example>
<p>For example, the following sets the color and vertical alignment of
some of the slots in a template:

<pre>
body { display: "aaa"
                "bcd" }
body::slot(b) { background: #FF0 }
body::slot(c), body::slot(d) { vertical-align: bottom }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The selector ''<var>E</var>::slot(<var>X</var>)'' selects the part
of an element <var>E</var> that falls inside the slot with name
<var>X</var> of a template <var>T</var>, where <var>T</var> is either
the template of <var>E</var> itself (if <var>E</var> is a <em>template
element</em>) or the template of the <em>template ancestor</em> of
<var>E</var>. If there is no such template <var>T</var>, or if it does
not contain a slot called <var>X</var>, the selector matches nothing.

<div class=example>
<p>The following example shows the difference between using the
'::slot()' pseudo-element in combination with a template element and
in combination with a descendant of such an element.

<pre>
body { display: "a b c" }          /* Make BODY a template element */
body::slot(a) { background: #FF0 } /* Color whole slot */
p::slot(a) { background: #FC0 }    /* Color intersection of P and slot a */

P { font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 1em }
P::slot(a) { font-size: 20pt }
</pre>
</div>

<p>The background of a slot is drawn immediately on top of the
background of the element itself. E.g., the background set on
''P::slot(a)'' is immediately in front of the background set on ''P''.

<p class=issue>Need to define exactly how properties apply, similarly
to :first-line: fictional tag sequence, ambiguous cases…

<p class=issue>Need to define the width when a slot has padding and
border, including when the width is too small.

<p class=note>Note that slots can have borders and padding, but no
margins (cf. table cells).

<h2 id=vertical-alignment>Vertical alignment</h2>

<p>The 'vertical-align' property of a '::slot()' pseudo-element can be
used to align elements vertically in a slot. The effect is as if the
<em title="anonymous block of a slot">hypothetical anonymous
block</em> that contains the slot's contents is positioned as
follows:
<dl>

  <dt>bottom

  <dd>The content of the slot is aligned to the bottom of the slot:
  the bottom margin edge of the anonymous block coincides with the
  bottom of the slot.

  <dt>middle

  <dd>The content of the slot is vertically centered in the slot: the
  distance between the top margin edge of the anonymous block and the
  top of the slot is equal to the distance between the bottom margin
  edge of the anonymous block and the bottom of the slot. <span
  class=note>(Note that if the content overflows the slot, it will
  overflow both at the top and at the bottom.)</span>

  <dt>baseline

  <dd>The anonymous block that encloses the content is placed as high
  as possible under two constraints:
  <ol>
  <li>The top margin edge of the anonymous block may not be higher
  than the top edge of the slot.

  <li>The topmost baseline in the content may not be higher than the
  topmost baseline of content in any other slot in the same row that
  also has 'vertical-align: baseline'. Baselines of content inside
  floats are not taken into account. Slots that span several rows are
  considered to occur in their topmost row.
  </ol>
</dl>

<p>For all other values, the content is top aligned: the top margin
edge of the anonymous box coincides with the top edge of the slot.



<h2 id=paged>Page-based templates and other templates in paged media</h2>

<p>A template can also be attached to a page, rather than an element. 
Such a template is called a <dfn>page-based template</dfn> as opposed
to an <dfn>element-based template.</dfn>

<p>The difference between page-based layout templates and
element-based ones is that the size of a slot in a page-based layout
template only depends on the template and the page size, never on the
intrinsic size of the content.

<p>Another difference is that content that overflows a slot may cause
a page break: the rest of the content is put on another page. See <a
href="#page-break">below.</a>

<p>The syntax of a page-based template is the same as that of an
element-based one, but the declaration appears in an '@page' rule and
any <var>&lt;col-width&gt;</var> or <var>&lt;row-height&gt;</var>
that is neither '*' nor a <var>&lt;length&gt;</var> is treated as if
it were '*'.

<p>Also, a <var>&lt;display-type&gt;</var> may be present, but has no
effect.

<p class=note>Although the occurrence of keywords, such as
''fit-content'' or ''auto'', is valid and well defined, a UA,
especially an editor, may want to issue a warning, because those
keywords don't have any useful function in page-based templates.

<div class=example>
<pre>
@page :first { display: "abc" "def" }
@page { display: "def" }

body {position: e}
h1 {position: b}
</pre>
</div>

<p>The default 'display' value of a page is ''display: "@"''.

<div class=example>
<p>The following rule is typically not needed, because it is the
default:

<pre>@page { display: "@" }</pre>
</div>

<p>The height of the slots in a template is computed as in the section
<a href="#rowheight">“Computing the height of the slots,”</a> except
that the <em title="page area">page area's</em> height [[!CSS3PAGE]]
is used instead of the
element's height. Similarly, the width of the slots is computed as in
the section <a href="#colwidth">“Computing the width of the slots,”
</a> but with the page area's width replacing the element's width.

<p class=note>Note that certain rules in those sections are never
applied, because the page area's width and height are always known
a-priori and the width and height of slots is always a
<var>&lt;length&gt;</var> or '*'.

<p id=page-break>If a slot of a page-based template on
<em>non-interactive</em> media has an 'overflow' property of
''visible'', then content that overflows that slot in the block
progression direction (i.e., below the slot in the case of horizontal
text) causes a page break and is continued on the next page. <span
class=issue>[What happens in non-interactive media with an 'overflow'
of ''scroll'' or ''auto''?]</span>

<p>For page breaking purposes, each slot is considered as a page and
the page break properties on the elements in that slot determine where
the content for that slot is broken. Content after the page break is
put in the slot of the same name on the next page that has such a
slot. If there is no such page <span class=issue>the content after the
page break is not displayed? displayed in the default slot?</span>

<p class=note>Note that this may happen if the template for the first
page ('@page :first') uses a letter that occurs in no other @page
rule. Possibly also if a page template is bound to a “named page”
[[CSS3GCPM]] and that named page is not allowed to repeat. (At the
time of writing, this is only a proposal in the GCPM Module.)

<p class=note>Note that an element <var>A</var> that appears later in
the document than an element <var>B</var> may thus be displayed on an
earlier page than element <var>B</var>, because their respective slots
are broken across pages in different ways.

<p>Because of limitations of a device (e.g., limited memory), it may
be that a UA has to print a page (force page breaks) even though some
slots aren't filled yet.

<div class=example>
<p>This example shows how the first page may have a different layout
from the other pages. The slot ''a'' only occurs on the first page. If
the content for that slot (in this case: all H1 elements) is too long,
the remaining content of that slot <span class=issue>will not be
displayed.</span> The slot ''@'' occurs on normal pages and all its
content can thus be displayed by adding additional pages.

<pre>
@page :first { display: "a" "@" }
@page { display: "@" /* This is the default */ }
h1 {position: a}
</pre>
</div>

<p class=note>Note that “page masters” (sequences of
different templates for sequences of pages) can be made with the
selectors defined in <span class=issue>[not yet decided].</span>

<p id=element-based-page-break>Element-based templates in paged media
may be broken across pages,
subject to the page break properties. In addition to the break points
listed in the Paged Media module [[!CSS3PAGE]], a page break may occur
between two rows in a template, if there is a possible break point at
the same height or higher in all slots that span those two rows; and a
page break may occur inside a row if there is a possible break point
in all slots in that row.

<p class=issue>Try to be more precise?

<p>If 'page-break-before' or 'page-break-after' is ''right'', ''left''
or ''always'' on an element inside a slot in an element-based
template, the value is treated as ''auto'' instead.

<p>The 'page' property does not apply to elements inside a slot of an
element-based template.

<p>Any other forced page break (see section 5.5 of Paged Media
[[!CSS3PAGE]]) causes a new page to be created and all content in the
document after this page break will be put in slots on the new page or
on later pages: slots on any previous pages will not be further
filled.

<div class=example>
<p>A slide presentation can be made with a template for each page
(i.e., slide) and forced page break between the slides:

<pre>
@page	{ display: "a" / 5em
	           "@" / *
	           "b" / auto }
h1	{ page-break-before: always;
	  position: a }
p.note	{ position: b }
</pre>
<p>With a document similar to this: (fragment)
<pre>
<b>&lt;h1></b>Slide 1 title<b>&lt;/h1></b>
<b>&lt;ul></b>
 <b>&lt;li></b>Topic one
<b>&lt;/ul></b>
<b>&lt;h1></b>Slide 2 title<b>&lt;/h1></b>
<b>&lt;ul></b>
 <b>&lt;li></b>More topics
<b>&lt;/ul></b>
<b>&lt;p class=note></b>Note the note
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>The document in the example above doesn't have an element that
corresponds to a slide; a slide simply starts at an H1 and ends before
the next H1. But if there is a DIV around each slide (as is the case
in many slide formats in practice), the same effect can also be
achieved without page-based templates, by using the ''vh'' unit
[[!CSS3VAL]]:

<pre>
div.slide {height: 100vh; display: "a"/5em "@" "b"/intrinsic;
    page-break-before: always}
h1 {position: a}
p.note {position: b}
</pre>

<p>With a document similar to this: (fragment)

<pre>
<b>&lt;div class=slide></b>
 <b>&lt;h1></b>Slide 1 title<b>&lt;/h1></b>
 <b>&lt;ul></b>
  <b>&lt;li></b>Topic one
 <b>&lt;/ul></b>
<b>&lt;/div></b>
<b>&lt;div class=slide></b>
 <b>&lt;h1></b>Slide 2 title<b>&lt;/h1></b>
 <b>&lt;ul></b>
  <b>&lt;li></b>More topics
 <b>&lt;/ul></b>
 <b>&lt;p class=note></b>Note the note
<b>&lt;/div></b>
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Both page-based and element-based templates can be used in the same
document.

<pre>
@page { display: "a@" }
:lang(fr} {position: a}
div.special {display: "abc" "abd"}
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Here is a page as one might find in a newspaper. It combines a
layout template with multicolumn layout.

<div class=figure>
  <p><img src="newspaper.png" alt="5-column newspaper page with some
  blocks of text that span several columns">

  <p class=caption>The front page of a newspaper, with the first parts
  of several stories that are continued on other pages and headings
  and images that span several columns.
</div>

<pre>
@page :first {
  display: "A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A  A" / 5cm
           ".  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ." / 0.25cm
           "B  .  C  C  C  C  C  C  C" / *

           "B  .  E  E  E  .  F  F  F" / *
            * 3em * 3em * 3em * 3em *
}
h1 {position: a; border-bottom: thick; margin-bottom: 1.5em}
#toc {position: b; margin-right: -1.5em; border-right: thin;

#art3 {position: f; columns: 2; column-gap: 3em}
</pre>
</div>

<p class=issue>If a slot on a page is full and the content continues
on the next page, it may be useful to insert something like 
“continued on page X.” This is useful at any page break, but more
important if there are multiple “flows” of content on each page.
Maybe a page-break-content property? 'page-break-content: "▶ continued on
p. " targetcounter(???, page)' or extend text-overflow from [[!CSS3TEXT]]?

<p class=issue>How do you set the 'vertical-align' property of a slot
in a page? Does the '::slot()' pseudo-element apply? '@page :first
:slot(A) {vertical-align: bottom}'


<h2 id=stacking-order>Stacking order</h2>

<p>An element with a computed value of a letter for its 'position'
is a <em>positioned element</em> (see [[!CSS3POS]]) and thus the
'z-index' property applies to it. The general rules
for <a href="/TR/CSS21/zindex">stacking
contexts</a> <span class=issue>[ref in CSS3?]</span> apply.

<p class=note>Note that an element can only have such a computed value
if it has an ancestor that is a <em>template element.</em>

<div class=example>
<p>This example uses 'z-index' and negative margins to make the
element in the middle slot partly overlap the other slots:

<pre>
body { display: "a.b"
                ".c."
                "d.e";
       height: 240px;
       width: 240px }
::slot(a) { background: #0C0 }
::slot(b) { background: #C00 }
::slot(d) { background: #00C }
::slot(e) { background: #A0A }
#c { background: #FD0; height: 120px; position: c;
     margin: -20px; z-index: 1 }
</pre>

<div class=figure>
  <p><img src="overlap.png" alt="Five colored rectangles">
  <p class=caption>Rendering of the above example.
</div>
</div>

<h2>Floating elements inside templates</h2>

<p>An element may be positioned inside a template (computed value of
<var>&lt;letter&gt;</var> for its 'position' property) and be a
floating element at the same time (computed value of its 'float'
property is other than ''none''). The following cases must be
distinguished:

<ul>
  <li>Page-based floats &ndash; In paged media (see [[!CSS3PAGE]]), if
  the value of 'float' specifies that the element floats to the top or
  bottom of the page (in a horizontal writing mode) or the left or
  right of the page (in a vertical writing mode), the 'position'
  property doesn't apply.

  <li>Normal floats &ndash; In other cases, the element floats
  normally within its containing block, which in this case is its slot
  in the template (as defined <a href="#containing-block">above</a>).
</ul>

<h2 id=gr-unit>Definition of the ''fr'' unit in a template element</h2>

<p>The Grid Layout Module [[CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]] defines a ''fr'' unit
(for “<strong>fr</strong>action”) that
is usable with certain properties that position or size boxes.
A <em>template element</em> defines an <em>implicit grid</em> (in the
terminology of that module) for use with the ''fr'' unit. The vertical
grid lines are formed by the left and right content edges of the
template element and by the edges between the columns of the template.
The horizontal grid lines are formed by the top and bottom content
edges of the template element and by the edges between the rows of the
template. The top content edge and the left content edge have the
number 0.

<p class=note>In other words, a template with <var>n</var> columns
and <var>m</var> rows defines <var>n</var> + 1 vertical grid lines
numbered 0 to <var>n</var> and <var>m</var> + 1 horizontal grid lines
numbered 0 to <var>m</var>.

<div class=example>
<p>For example, with the following style sheet
<pre>
div {
  display: "abc"
           "def";
  position: relative}
p {
  position: f}
#p1 {
  position: absolute;
  top: 1fr;
  left: 2fr}
</pre>
<p>and this document fragment
<pre>
&lt;div>
 &lt;p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetaur adipisicing elit, sed
 do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
 &lt;p id=p1>Position me.
&lt;/div>
</pre>
<p>the “p1” element will be positioned with its top left corner
against the top left corner of slot f. But note that it is not part of
the content of slot f, it overlaps with it.
</div>

<h2 id=chains>Chaining slots: the 'chains' property</h2>

<p>Slots must be rectangular, but the appearance of non-rectangular
slots can be achieved to a large extent by chaining slots together.
Content that is positioned in the first slot of a chain is
automatically continued in the second slot if the first slot is full,
and then the third, etc.

<table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <td>Name:
      <td><dfn>chains</dfn>
    <tr>
      <td>Value:
      <td>none | <var>&lt;letter&gt;</var>+
	[ , <var>&lt;letter&gt;</var>+ ]*
    <tr>
      <td>Initial:
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <td>Applies to:
      <td><span title="template element">template elements</span>
    <tr>
      <td>Inherited:
      <td>no
    <tr>
      <td>Percentages:
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td>Media:
      <td>visual
    <tr>
      <td>Computed&nbsp;value:
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>A value of ''none'' means the element's template has no chains.
Otherwise the value consists of one or more comma-separated lists of
letters. No letter may appear more than once in the value. Letters
that do not occur in the <em>template</em> are ignored, but do not
make the value invalid. A list with only ignored letters is itself
ignored.

<p>All the non-ignored letters in a list, except for the last one,
must refer to slots whose size does not depend on their contents,
otherwise the list is ignored. The size of a slot does not depend on
its content if all the columns and all the rows that the slot spans
have a width, respectively height, that is a <var>&lt;length&gt;</var>
or '*'.

<p>Each non-ignored list defines one <dfn>chain.</dfn>

<p>Each chain is filled with content in an analogous way to the pages
in paged media: all the content that is positioned to the first slot
in the chain is flowed, in document order, into the first slot in the
chain until the slot is full, the rest is flowed into the second slot
until it is full, etc.

<p>Content must only be split between slots at an allowed page break
[[!CSS3PAGE]]. As for page breaks, if a break occurs in the margin
between blocks, all adjoining margins are set to zero.

<p>CSS3 does not define what is the best break point to split content
over slots. However, it is recommended to use the last possible break
point that does not cause overflow. (If such a break point exists.)

<p class=note>Note: It is the author's responsibility to make the
height of relevant slots an integral number of lines if he wants to
ensure that the lines in chained slots are aligned. The height does
not automatically “snap” to a multiple of the line height.

<div class=example>
<p>The following template creates a double-staircase layout. In case
the content is too long for the staircase, a slot of flexible height
is added at the bottom.
<pre>
div { display: "@@..ff...." / 3.6em
               ".aa..gg..." / 3.6em
               "..bb..hh.." / 3.6em
               "...cc..ii." / 3.6em
               "....dd..jj" / 3.6em
               ".........." / 0.6em
               "eeee..kkkk" / auto;
   chains: @ a b c d e, f g h i j k}
#first { position: @ }
#second { position: f }
</pre>
<p>This could be applied to a document fragment such as
<pre>
&lt;DIV&gt;
  &lt;P ID=first&gt;...
  &lt;P ID=second&gt;...
&lt;/DIV&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Here is a paragraph shaped as a circle:
<pre>
p { width: 12em;
    display: ". . . . @ @ . . . ." / 1.2em
             ". . a a a a a a . ." / 1.2em
             ". b b b b b b b b ." / 1.2em
             ". b b b b b b b b ." / 1.2em
             "c c c c c c c c c c" / 1.2em
             "c c c c c c c c c c" / 1.2em
             ". d d d d d d d d ." / 1.2em
             ". d d d d d d d d ." / 1.2em
             ". . e e e e e e . ." / 1.2em
             ". . . . f f . . . ." / 1.2em
             "g g g g g g g g g g" / auto;
   chains: @ a b c d e f g }
</pre>
</div>

<div class=example>
<p>Here is a page-based template that creates a two-column layout
with a “hole” in the center:
<pre>
@page:first {
    display:
    "aaaaaaa.ddddddd"
    "aaaaaaa.ddddddd"
    "aaaaaaa.ddddddd"
    "aaaaaaa.ddddddd"
    "bbbb.......eeee"
    "bbbb.ggggg.eeee"
    "bbbb.ggggg.eeee"
    "bbbb.ggggg.eeee"
    "bbbb.......eeee"
    "ccccccc.fffffff"
    "ccccccc.fffffff"
    "ccccccc.fffffff"
    "ccccccc.fffffff";
    chains: a b c d e f }
@page::slot(g) {
    vertical-align: middle }

body { position: a }
h1 { position: g }
</pre>
</div>

<p class=note>Note: For more anaylysis of the possibilities and limits
of non-rectangular slots, see the PhD thesis of César Acebal
[[ACEBAL2010]].

<div class=issue>
<p>Chaining of rectangular slots is not enough to create layouts with
holes, e.g., an image in the middle of a text. Allowing
non-rectangular, <em>connected</em> regions (in addition to chaining)
would allow an example such as this:
<pre>
display: "A A A . . ."
         "A . A . . ."
         "A A A . . ."
         ". . . B B B"
         ". . . B . B"
         ". . . B B B";
chains: a b;
</pre>
<p>Such cutouts in the middle of text usually create text that is
difficult to read, and that is why there is no 'float: center', e.g.
</div>

<p class=note>Note that a slot can have overflowing content even if it
is part of a <span>chain</span>: it can have content that is too wide
and content that is too tall but cannot be broken.

<h2>Breaking content between slots in a chain</h2>

<p>The 'break-before', 'break-after' and 'break-inside' properties
have values that control breaking of content between slots in a chain
(in addition to the values that control breaks between pages and
columns, defined in [[!CSS3PAGE]] and [[!CSS3COL]]):

<table class=propdef-extra>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td>'break-inside'
    <tr>
      <td><em>New value:</em>
      <td>avoid-slot
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<table class=propdef-extra>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Name:</em>
      <td>'break-before', 'break-after'
    <tr>
      <td><em>New value:</em>
      <td>slot | avoid-slot
    <tr>
      <td><em>Percentages:</em>
      <td>N/A
    <tr>
      <td><em>Computed&nbsp;value:</em>
      <td>specified value
</table>

<p>The new values are:

<dl>
<dt>avoid-slot <dd>Avoid a break inside (before, after) the generated
box.

<dt>slot <dd>Always force a break before (after) the generated box.
</dl>

<h2 id=cr-exit-criteria>CR exit criteria</h2>

<p>For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
following terms:

<dl>
  <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
  different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
  used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
  have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
  exempt from this requirement.

  <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
  official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
  browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
  suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
  agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
  if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
  must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
  equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
  interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
  available for the purposes of peer review.

  <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:

  <ol class=inline>

    <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
    be a shipping product or other publicly available version
    (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
    Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the

<p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
six months.

<p>A <a href="/Style/CSS/Test/">test suite</a> will

<h2 id=history>History</h2>

<p><em>(This section is not normative.)</em>

<p class=mtb>The following types of use cases were considered for
template-based layout.

<ol>
<li><p>Standard Web pages.

<li><p>Grids and other table-like layouts. This includes grid layouts,
frame layouts and table-like subdivision of a rectangular area.

<li><p>A layout structure with “flex”ing information. The
flexing is represented by constraints that specify how the cells are
to relate to one another: which cells are to be allowed to grow or
shrink and how much. There may also be a priority ordering, which
determines, based on the size of the allowed display window, which
cells shrink, which grow and under which conditions.

<li><p>Layout structures with absolutely positioned (fixed-size)
elements; for example a block of text into which several illustrations
intrude at fixed positions within the block. This is like a float with
respect to tightly wrapping the text around the intrusion, but the
position of the intrusion is determined by the layout structure, not
the content flowed into that structure.

<p>An example of this is a multicolumn layout with one or more
“absolutely positioned floats” that intrude on the columns
(see <a href="#intrusion">figure</a>).

<div class=figure id=intrusion>
  <p><img src="cutout.svg" alt="An image that partially overlaps two
  columns makes the text wrap around it on both sides."

  <p class=caption>An image (or a “pull quote”) is placed centered
  on the page and intrudes on two areas.
</div>

<li><p>Multiple, disconnected, fixed-size areas on a page that are
chained together, each one receiving the content that doesn't fit in
the previous slot. In combination with page breaks, this may give a
layout as often seen in newspapers: the first few lines of each story
on the first page, the rest of the story in other areas on subsequent
pages. (It will probably need a way to conditionally insert “continued
on page&nbsp;7” or similar text.)
</ol>

<p>For comparing proposals for template-based layouts, the working
group identified four important aspects of each proposal:

<ol>
<li><p>the physical layout structures &ndash; the way of structuring
the “cells” (slots) into which content is flowed. This
includes a way to identify the various layout containers.

<li><p>the binding mechanism &ndash; the way to specify that a given
element (and its descendants) are to be placed in a given layout cell.

<li><p>the property distribution mechanism &ndash; the way to put
properties onto the layout structure and the cells within it.

<li><p>the flexing mechanism &ndash; the way to describe how the
layout structure should adapt itself to the higher level container
(window) in which it is placed. This includes statements about which
cells should grow and when they should grow.
</ol>

<p>In this specification, these aspects are as follows:

<ol>
<li><p>A character matrix is used to show the layout structure and the
cells are named by the character used to show where they are
positioned.

<li><p>The binding of content to cells is handled by the 'position'
property which identifies a cell to which the content is bound.

<li><p>The shape, size and flexibility of the layout are specified
with the character matrix. Some properties (background, border and
vertical alignment) are attached to individual slots.

<li><p>There is limited “flexing” information. The choice is between
fixed size, a fraction of the available size or the content's
intrinsic size. (The latter is further subject to min/max sizes
specified on that content.) It is not possible to say, e.g., that some
column can only become wider if all other columns are at their maximum
size.
</ol>

<h2 class="no-num" id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>The first ideas for describing a template in CSS date from 1996 and
are described in <a href="/TR/NOTE-layout"><cite>Frame-based layout
via Style Sheets</cite></a> by Bert Bos, Dave Raggett and Håkon Wium
Lie. The idea was revived in 2005 on the request of W3C's Device
Independence Working Group and benefited especially from discussions
with Rhys Lewis and Rotan Hanrahan from that group.

<p>This specification was further influenced by ideas about form
layout by <a

<h2 id=changes>Changes</h2>

<p>Summary of changes since 
<a href="/TR/2010/WD-css3-layout-20100429/" >29 April 2010 draft:</a>

<ul class=issue>
<li>Added the 'chains' property to create sequences of slots.
<li>Added <a href="#slot-pseudo">region-based styling:</a> properties
can be set on the part of an element that is inside a slot, different
from the part that is in a different slot, using the 'slot()'
pseudo-element.
<li>Added more properties that apply to a slot itself.
<li>Digits are now allowed as names for slots (in addition to letters).
<li>The  'gr' unit is renamed to 'fr' (see [[CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]).
<li>List items and table elements can now also have templates.
<li>Added some more issues and links to the issue tracker.
</ul>
