<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="context">Background</h3>

  <p><em>This section is not normative.</em></p>

  <p>This specification provides features to align lines and blocks
    to invisible grids in the document.</p>

  <p>Aligning lines and blocks to grids provides the following benefits:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Vertical rhythm is kept for better readability.</li>
    <li>Lines are aligned between columns in multi-column documents.</li>
    <li>The top and the bottom margins of pictures are made equal,
      while keeping the vertical rhythm of text before and after the pictures.</li>
    <!--
    <li>Aligning to grids can sometimes be turned off for objects like tables,
      but then turned back on for the following text
      to the same grids as the one for the text before the objects.</li>
    -->
    <li>Layout lines are at the same position on every page in paged media.
      Keeping the position of the bottom line of a page has benefits for
      design and readability.
      This also improves the readability of duplex printing,
      two pages spreads,
      and displaying on slow display devices like e-ink.</li>
    <li>East Asian layouts require vertical rhythm
      more often than other scripts do,
      even in single column, non-paged media documents,
      as defined in [[JLREQ]].</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are several types of objects in a document
    that can break the vertical rhythm.
    Examples include lines with different sizes of text, pictures, and tables.</p>

  <div class="figure">
    <img src="line-grid-multicol.png"
      width="480" height="246"
      alt="Vertical rhythm kept through pictures and different size of text in a multi-column document"
      />
    <p class="caption">Vertical rhythm kept through pictures and different size of text in a multi-column document.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <div class="sidefigure">
      <img src="line-grid-wrap.png"
        width="276" height="244"
        alt="Large text wraps within line grids"
        />
      <p class="caption">Large text wraps within line grids.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When a different size of text, such as a headings, wraps,
      it is usually aligned to grids as a block and
      the lines within the block do not align.</p>

    <br style="clear:both;"/>
   </div>

  <div id="ex-sidenote" class="figure">
    <div class="sidenote-block">
      <div class="sidenote-body">
        Sidenotes (and footnotes for that matter) are often set
        at a smaller size than the basic text.
        This smaller text should still line up with the basic text.
        Authors can achieve this effect
        by calculating appropriate font-size, line-height,
        and margins*.
      </div>
      <div class="sidenote-note">
        Only if author controls everything.
        It can easily be broken by user stylesheet, for instance.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="caption">Sidenotes are set at a smaller size, but still line up with the basic text.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="ex-width" class="sidefigure">
    <img src="width-multiple-of-em.png"
      width="180" height="142"
      alt="East Asian layouts may require width be a multiple of em without fractions"
      />
    <p class="caption">East Asian layouts may require width
      be a multiple of <em>em</em> without fractions.</p>
  </div>

  <p>East Asian layouts may require grid-like features
    in inline progression direction as well.</p>
  <p>It is often desirable in East Asian layouts
    to make the line width
    a multiple of <em>em</em> without fractions.
    Because most East Asian characters have 1em advance
    and most East Asian documents are justified,
    this minimizes cases where justification needs to expand character spacing.</p>

  <p>This module provides the following capabilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defining grids in the line progression direction.</li>
    <li>Controling how lines and blocks align to the grids.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is important to control these capabilities independently,
    so that, for example, aligning to grids can be turned off for tables,
    but can then be turned back on for aligning the following text to the grids.
  </p>


<h3 id="placement">Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>This module extends the line box model defined in [[!CSS21]] sections
  9.4.2 and 10.8.

<h3 id="values">Values</h3>

  <p>This specification follows the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
  definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
  this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
  Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
  example [[CSS3COLOR]], when combined with this module, expands the
  definition of the &lt;color&gt; value type as used in this specification.</p>
  
  <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
  all properties defined in this specification also accept the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
  keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
  explicitly.

Defining a Line Grid: the 'line-grid' property</h2>

  </table>

  <p>Specifies whether this box creates a new baseline grid for its descendants
  or uses the same baseline grid as its parent.
  (Each box always has an associated line grid.
  However, whether a box or its contents snap to a line grid
  is determined by ''line-snap'' and ''box-snap''.)

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>''match-parent''</dfn>
    <dd>Box assumes the line grid of its parent.

    <dt><dfn>''create''</dfn>
    <dd>Box creates a new line grid using its own font and line layout settings.
    The line grid consists of a series of horizontal lines corresponding to
    all the baselines (alphabetic, text-top, text-bottom,  mathematic, central, hanging, etc.)
    and to the line-over and line-under edges,
    positioned where they would fall if the contents of this element consisted
    entirely of line boxes filled with text (no sub-elements) using the first
    available font.
    If the box is paginated, the line grid is restarted on each page;
    since line boxes cannot be fragmented,
    no page begins with the bottom part of a line's grid.
  </dl>

  <p>

  <p class="issue">The names of these values is currently up for debate.
  Current suggestions for ''match-parent'' include ''match-parent'' and ''normal'';
  those for ''create'' include ''create'' and ''new''.

  <p class="note">The original proposal for line grids allowed an element
  to create a named grid.
  This property could still be extended to do this in the future.

  <p class="issue"><a href="http://www.w3.org/mid/21262.26596.32230.32937@gargle.gargle.HOWL">Håkon points out</a> that
  there might be a need to have line grids aligned
  to the page box rather than the page content box.
  The current proposal has no way to switch between the two.
  
  <p class="note">There might need to be an offset for more complicated designs.
  How to set this offset is problematic:
  usually it's not a fixed length, but the distance to clear some header content. 
  This could be added to a later level of line-grid.

<h2>Snapping to a Grid</h2>

<h3 id=line-snap>
Snapping Line Boxes: the 'line-snap' property</h3>

  <table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>line-snap</dfn>
    <tr>
      <th><a href="#values">Value</a>:
      <td>none | baseline | contain
    <tr>
      <th>Initial:
      <td>none
    <tr>
      <th>Applies to:
      <td>all elements

    <tr>
      <th>Canonical order:
      <td><abbr title="follows order of property value definition">per grammar<abbr>
  </table>

  <p>This property applies to all the line boxes directly contained by
  the element, and, when not ''none'', causes each line box to shift
  (usually downward, possibly by zero) until it snaps to the line grid specified
  by 'line-grid'. (The unshifted position is the position that would be
  determined by normal line stacking rules, with consideration of any
  new controls defined by other modules such as [[CSS3LINE]].) Values
  have the following meanings:

  <dl>
  <dt><dfn>''none''</dfn>
    <dd>Line boxes do not snap to the grid; they stack normally.
  <dt><dfn>''baseline''</dfn>
    <dd>The dominant baseline snaps with the matching baseline on the
    line grid applying to the element.
  <dt><dfn>''contain''</dfn>
    <dd>Two baselines are used to align the line box: the line box is
    snapped so that its ''central'' baseline (halfway between the
    ''text-over'' and ''text-under'' baselines) is centered between
    one of the line grid's ''text-over'' baselines and a subsequent
    (but not necessarily consecutive) ''text-under'' baseline.
  </dl>

  <p>In some cases lines of equal line height will not align perfectly
  to a baseline grid: this happens, for example, when fonts (of the same
  size) with different baseline tables are mixed on a line.
  For this reason, if shifting the line by the largest difference between
  the smallest ascent and largest ascent of a single size used on the line
  would result in a smaller shift, then the contents of the line box are
  shifted up within the line box so as to allow the line to snap without
  jumping downward to the next grid line.

  <div class="example">
    <p>When a block is start-aligned, 
      its line boxes will always shift downward 
      when snapping to a line grid. 
      Here and in the next two examples  
      there are two lines (A and B) with line-snap:none 
      and two or three lines (1, 2 and 3) with line-snap:baseline. 
      Here lines 1, 2 and 3 shift down 
      to snap their baselines to the line grid.

  <div class="example">

    <p>A center-aligned block's line boxes shift nearly the same as a start-aligned block's. All the lines except for the very first snapped line (line 1 in this example) shift exactly the same as a start-aligned block. Then the block is centered, and the shortest distance from the first snapped line's baseline to a grid line is measured. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If the closest grid line is in the block-start direction, then the entire block is shifted up from the block-end edge to snap the first line to the grid when the block is centered again.

Snapping Block Boxes: the 'box-snap' property</h3>

  <p class="issue">
  This is a rough draft of trying to solve the box-snapping problem.

  <p class="issue">
  Some optional box values (margin-box, border-box) could be added 
  to the before and after values 
  to allow snapping various box model edges to the line grid.

  <p class="issue">
  An 'auto' value could be useful - one that defaults to center, 
  but snaps to before if it's the first block in a fragment container, 
  and snaps to after if it's the last block in a fragment container.

  <table class=propdef>
    <tr>
      <th>Name:
      <td><dfn>box-snap</dfn>

  <p>Specifies how the block is snapped to the baseline grid. 
  Values have the following meanings:

  <dl>
  <dt><dfn>none</dfn>
    <dd>The block is not snapped to any grid.</dd>
  <dt><dfn>before</dfn>
    <dd>The before edge is snapped to the nearest grid line.
  <dt><dfn>after</dfn>
    <dd>The after edge is snapped to the nearest grid line.
  <dt><dfn>center</dfn>
    <dd>The block is centered centered between
    one of the baseline grid's ''text-over'' baselines and a subsequent
    (but not necessarily consecutive) ''text-under'' baseline.
  <dt><dfn>first-baseline</dfn>
    <dd>The first line box's dominant baseline is snapped to the nearest grid line.
  <dt><dfn>last-baseline</dfn>
    <dd>The last line box's dominant baseline is snapped to the nearest grid line.
  </dl>

  <p>When snapping to baselines on a line grid, either the <i>text-over</i>
  or <i>text-under</i> baseline is chosen: whichever one is on the matching
  side of the central baseline. For example, when snapping the before edge
  in horizontal writing mode, the <i>over</i> edge is chosen. In some
  cases the <i>under</i> edge might be used instead for the before edge:
  for example, when the writing mode of the line grid doesn't match that of
  the affected element, or when due to the 'text-orientation' settings the
  <i>under</i> side corresponds to the <i>after</i> edge.

  <p>To snap a block-level element to a grid line, the effective margin is increased
  at that edge. <!--To snap an after border-box or half-border edge to a grid
  line, the effective content-box height is increased.--> 
  If, however, the box is an empty block that could be
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html">collapsed through</a>,
  then this property has no effect. [[!CSS21]]

  <p>When applied to table row group and table row boxes, 'box-snap' only
  affects the before and after edges, and only if those edges are not at
  the beginning or end of the table, respectively. To snap a before edge
  on a table row or row group, the preceding row's height is increased.
  To snap an after edge on a table row or row group, the affected row's
  height is increased.

  <p>When applied to table column group and table column boxes, 'box-snap'
  only affects the start and end edges, and only if those edges are not at
  the start or end of the table, respectively. How the space is redistributed
  among columns to satisfy snapping constraints is not defined, however:
  <ul>
    <li>In an auto-sized table no column may be smaller than its minimum
       content width.
    <li>The resulting table must not exceed its original measure if it
      had a non-''auto'' measure.
    <li>The adjusted widths must not cause the table to overflow its
      containing block any more than it would with ''box-snap: none''.
  </ul>
  <p>To satisfy these constraints, some column edges may remain unsnapped.
<!-- 
  Line snapping for columnsis processed from start to end: column widths
  are increased or decreased in order to snap the column edges.
  By preference, the widths are increased.
  However if the table has an explicit size or is auto-sized and the resulting
  table overflows its containing block, then columns whose widths were
  increased must, one by one, switch their snap to decreasing the column
  width, until the table reaches its specified size or 
-->
<!--
  <p>For internal table elements in separated borders tables, ''margin-box''
  represents the edge at the midpoint of the border spacing. For collapsed
  tables, ''margin-box'' and ''border-box'' are treated as ''half-border''.
  When two coinciding edges have conflicting snap values, the later value
  wins.

  have values that are valid according to the generic CSS grammar and the
  individual grammars of each property as given in this module.
  
  <p>A renderer is conformant to CSS Line Grid Level 1
  if, in addition to interpreting the style sheet as defined by the
  appropriate specifications, it supports all the properties defined
  by CSS Line Grid Level 1 by parsing them correctly
  and rendering the document accordingly. However, the inability of a
  UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device
  does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not
  required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  
  <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Line Grid Level 1
  if it writes syntactically correct style sheets, according to the
  generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each property in
  this module.

<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to
  assign fallback values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong>
  treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignore
  as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
  and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of
  support. In particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively
  ignore unsupported component values and honor supported values in a single
  multi-value property declaration: if any value is considered invalid
  (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires that the entire declaration
  be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS specifications
  reserve a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed
  syntax</a> for proprietary property and value extensions to CSS. The CSS
  Working Group recommends that experimental implementations of features in
  CSS Working Drafts also use vendor-prefixed property or value names. This
  avoids any incompatibilities with future changes in the draft. Once a
  specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage, implementors
  should implement the non-prefixed syntax for any feature they consider to
  be correctly implemented according to spec.</p>

<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p>
  For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation,
  there must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations
  of each feature. Each feature may be implemented by a different set of
  products, there is no requirement that all features be implemented by
  a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define the
  following terms:
  
  <dl>
    <dt>independent <dd>each implementation must be developed by a
    different party and cannot share, reuse, or derive from code
    used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that
    have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are
    exempt from this requirement.
  
    <dt>interoperable <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the
    official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation is not a Web
    browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
    suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user
    agent (UA) is to be used to claim interoperability. In addition
    if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability, then there
    must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those
    equivalent tests in the same way for the purpose of
    interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
    available for the purposes of peer review.
  
    <dt>implementation <dd>a user agent which:
  
    <ol class=inline>
      <li>implements the specification.
  
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may
      be a shipping product or other publicly available version
      (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly build”). 
      Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the
      feature(s) for a period of at least one month in order to
      demonstrate stability.
  
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed
      to pass the test suite and is not intended for normal usage
      going forward).
    </ol>
  </dl>
  
  <p>The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least
  six months.
