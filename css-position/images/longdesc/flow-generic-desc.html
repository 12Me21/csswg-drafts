        <p>
            A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each 24px high. Four lines 
            of text are displayed, occupying line 1 through 4.

            In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by two lines, the second 
            beginning with the appropriate number. The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:
        </p>
        <pre>
1 Beginning of body contents. Start 

2 of outer contents. Inner contents.

3 End of outer contents. End of body

4 contents.
</pre>
