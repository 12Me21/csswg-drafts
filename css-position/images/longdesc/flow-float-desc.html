        <h1>Long description of example illustrating floating</h1>
        <p>This diagram illustrates the effects of floating a box.</p>
        <p>
            A document window is shown, with 8 lines (numbered 1 to 8), each 24px high. Since the 
            "inner" box has been floated to the right, all other text flows around it (on lines 1 
            through 4).
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following PRE element, each 24 pixel line is simulated by two lines, the second 
            beginning with the appropriate number. Vertical bars represent the left edge of the 
            floated box. The lines, as they appear in the image, contain:
        </p>
        <pre>
1 Beginning of body contents. Start

2 of outer contents. End | Inner

3 of outer contents. End | contents.

4 of body contents.
</pre>
        <p>
            The default text color is black. "Start of outer contents" is red. "Inner contents" is 
            blue. "End of outer contents" is red.
