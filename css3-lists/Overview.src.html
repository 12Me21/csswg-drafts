Abstract</h2>

	<p>CSS is a language for describing the rendering of structured documents
	(such as HTML and XML) on screen, on paper, in speech, etc.
	This draft contains the features of CSS level&nbsp;3 relating to
	list styling. It includes and extends the functionality of
	CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]], which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1
	[[CSS1]]. The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;2 are

<h2>
Introduction</h2>

	<p>The list model in this module differs in some important ways from the list model in CSS2,
	specifically in its handling of markers. Implementation experience suggested the CSS2 model
	overloaded the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements with too much behavior, while at the same time
	introducing new properties when existing properties were sufficient.</p>

	<p>Most block-level elements in CSS generate one principal block box. In this module, we discuss two
	CSS mechanisms that cause an element to have an associated marker: one method associates one
	principal block box (for the element's content) with a separate marker box (for decoration such as a
	bullet, image, or number), and the other inserts a marker box into the principal box. Unlike :before
	and :after content, the marker box cannot affect the position of the principal box, whatever the
	positioning scheme.</p>

	<div class="html-example">

		<p>For instance, the following example illustrates how markers may be used to add parentheses around
		each numbered list item. This HTML application and style sheet:</p>

		<pre>
&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
  &lt;title>Creating a list with markers&lt;/title>
  &lt;style>
   li::marker { content: "(" counter(list-item, lower-roman) ")"; }
   li { display: list-item; }
  &lt;/style>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;ol>
   &lt;li>This is the first item.&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>This is the second item.&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>This is the third item.&lt;/li>
  &lt;/ol>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
		</pre>

		<p>should produce something like this: </p>

		<pre>
  (i) This is the first item.
 (ii) This is the second item.
(iii) This is the third item.
</pre>
	</div>

	<p>With descendant selectors and child selectors, it's possible to specify different marker types
	depending on the depth of embedded lists.</p>

	<p class="issue">A future release of this module will probably include ways to render tree
	lists.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2>
Declaring a List Item</h2>

	<p>To declare a list item, the 'display'
	property should be set to ''list-item''. This, in addition to generating
	a ''::marker'' pseudo-element and enabling the
	properties described below for that element, causes that element to
	increment the list item counter ''list-item''.
	(This does not affect the specified or computed values of the counter
	properties.)</p>

	<p>The ''list-item'' counter is a real counter,
	and can be directly affected using the 'counter-increment' and ''counter-reset'' 
	properties. It can also be used in the ''counter()'' and ''counters()'' functions.</p>

	<p class="issue">The CSS3 box module may define other 'display' values which generate a list
	marker. These should also affect the ''list-item'' counter.</p>

	<p>Note that this new model makes the ''marker''
	display type redundant. That display type is therefore obsolete in the
	CSS3 Lists model.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id=list-style-type-property>
List Content: The 'list-style-type' property</h2>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>list-style-type</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td><b>&lt;string></b> | <b>&lt;counter-style></b> | none
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>disc
		<tr>
			<th>Applies To:
			<td>all elements with ''display: list-item''
		<tr>
			<th>Inherited:
			<td>yes
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value:
			<td>specified value
	</table>

	<p>This property specifies the default contents of the list item
	marker if 'list-style-image' has the
	value 'none' or if the image pointed to by the URI cannot be
	displayed. The value 'none' specifies no marker, and a string value uses the 
	given string; otherwise, the value specifies a <b>&lt;counter-style></b> which 
	is used to format the value of the ''list-item'' counter.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>&lt;string></dfn></dt>
		<dd>The ''::marker'' pseudoelement must use the provided string as its default
		contents.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>none</dfn></dt>
		<dd>The ''::marker'' pseudoelement must have no default contents.  This will 
		suppress the creation of a marker unless the ''::marker'' has its contents 
		specified directly through the 'content' property.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>&lt;counter-style></dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The ''::marker'' pseudoelement's default contents must be the value of 
			the ''list-item'' counter, formatted according to the given counter style.  
			Algorithms for formatting a value according to a counter style are given 
			later in this spec.</p>
			<p>The <b>UA style sheet</b> given later in this spec provides a large list
			of counter style definitions, and authors or users may define their own
			counter styles as well.</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id='predefined-counters'>
Predefined Counter Styles</h2>

	<p>While authors may define their own counter styles using the ''@counter-style''
	rule defined in this spec, there are many counter styles that CSS already defined
	in previous levels, and many more that can be usefully predefined.  Appendix A
	contains a required UA stylesheet which defines a large number of counter styles 
	using the ''@counter-style'' rule.  A few styles require special handling beyond
	what can be expressed in a stylesheet, though.  Those counter styles are described
	in this section.



<h3 id='decimal-counters'>
The ''decimal'' counter style</h3>

	<p>The ''decimal'' counter style is the default fallback counter style for the
	''@counter-style'' rule, and is also used in extraordinary situations like fallback
	loop.  As such, it has to be well-defined at all times, so that a counter can 
	always be formatted regardless of the validity of the defined counter styles.</p>

	<p>UAs must not allow the definition of the ''decimal'' counter style given in 
	Appendix A to be overridden.</p>



<h3 id='glyph-counters'>
Glyphs</h3>

	<p>CSS 2.1 defined three single-glyph counter styles (''circle'', ''disc'', and 
	''square''), but didn't define precisely how to render them, instead opting to
	describe generally how they should look and leaving it up to the UA to decide how
	to render the markers.</p>

	<p>Appendix A gives normative definitions for these styles, but UAs may instead 
	default to rendering these styles using a browser-generated image matching the
	description below.  If the styles are overridden, the new style must be honored; 
	this relaxation of the rendering requirements applies only to the default value 
	of each counter style.</p>

	<p>If the UA chooses to use an image for the default rendering of these counter 
	styles, the image must be scalable and designed to attractively fill a box 1em
	wide and 1em tall.</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>circle</dt>
		<dd>A hollow circle, similar to ◦ U+25E6 WHITE BULLET.</dd>

		<dt>disc</dt>
		<dd>A filled circle, similar to • U+2022 BULLET.</dd>

		<dt>square</dt>
		<dd>A filled square, similar to ■ U+25A0 BLACK SQUARE.</dd>
	</dl>



<h3 id='complex-counters'>
Complex counter styles</h3>

	<p>Some real-life counter styles are unfortunately too complex to be accurately
	described using the ''@counter-style'' rule.  The following styles must be supported
	as default counter styles as if they were defined by theoretical 
	''@counter-style'' rules placed at the end of the UA stylesheet defined in Appendix 
	A, using the given name as the counter style name and the given algorithm to format
	counter values.  They must be overrideable like any other predefined counter style.</p>


<h4 id='hebrew'>
The 'hebrew' counter style</h4>

	<p>This is a simple additive system defined for the range 1 to 999999.
	The digits are split into two groups of three. Within each group,
	appropriate digits are picked from the following list (at most one per
	column) and written in descending order by value (hundreds first). If
	there is more than one group, the first group is followed by U+05F3 HEBREW
	PUNCTUATION GERESH.</p>

	<p>If the last two digits of a group (when represented in decimal) are 15
	or 16, they should be expressed not as יה U+05D9 U+05D4
	(10+5) and יו U+05D9 U+05D5 (10+6), but as
	טו U+05D8 U+05D5 (9+6) and טז U+05D8 U+05D6
	(9+7). This is done to avoid a close resemblance to the Tetragrammaton
	(four-letter name of God) יהוה U+05D9 U+05D4
	U+05D5 U+05D4. Although this convention is originally derived from
	religious practice, it is universally used even in completely secular
	contexts.</p>

	<p>The numerical value of each letter is fixed and not determined by
	position, so reordering a number group will not change its value. This
	may be done when a number spells out a word with negative connotations.
	For instance, 298, רצח U+05E8 U+05E6 U+05D7
	(200+90+8), is the Hebrew for "murder", so it is sometimes written as
	רחצ U+05E8 U+05D7 U+05E6 (200+8+90). Words are
	sometimes similarly rearranged when a reordered form has especially
	positive connotations, for example 18, יח U+05D9 U+05D7
	(10+8) is often written as חי U+05D7 U+05D9 (8+10), the
	Hebrew for "alive". Unlike the exception for 15 and 16, using the
	regular form in these cases is not considered an error.</p>

	<p>The suffix for the hebrew numbering system is a dot (. U+002E
	FULL STOP).</p>

	<p>Numbers outside the range of the Hebrew system are rendered using the
	''decimal'' counter style.</p>

		<li>Index each group sequentially, starting from the least significant
		as group number zero.</li>

The Chinese counter styles</h4>

	<p>The Chinese counter styles are defined for all numbers between -10<sup>16</sup>

	(given below). The following algorithm converts decimal digits into Chinese 
	numbers:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the counter value is 0, the representation is simply the character
		for 0 from the counter style's table, below.  End this algorithm.</li>

		<li>If the counter value is negative, set the <var>negative flag</var>
		and run the rest of this algorithm with the absolute value of the counter
		value.</li>

		<li>Split the decimal number into groups of four digits, starting with 
		the least significant digit.</li>

		<li>Ignoring groups that have the value 0, append the second group marker 
		to the second group, the third group marker to the third group, and the 
		fourth group marker to the fourth group.  The first group has no marker.</li>

		<li>For each group, ignoring digits that have the value 0, append the 
		second digit marker to the second digit, the third digit marker to the 
		third digit, and the fourth digit marker to the fourth digit. The first 
		digit has no marker.</li>

		<li>For each group, drop any trailing 0s.  As well, drop any leading 0s
		for the largest group.</li>

		<li>Concatenate the groups back into a single string, least significant
		group first (on the right).</li>

		<li>Collapse any runs of consecutive 0s into a single 0.
		<span class=note>This can cross the previous group boundaries.</span></li>

		<li>Replace each digit with the relevant character from the counter style's
		table, below.</li>

		<li>If the <var>negative flag</var> is set, prepend 負 U+8D1F to the string.</li>

The Japanese counter styles</h4>

	<p>The Japanese counter styles are defined for all non-negative numbers less
	than 10<sup>16</sup>.  There are two Japanese counter styles which are constructed
	using the same algorithm, but different sets of characters (given below).  
	The following algorithm converts decimal digits into Japanese numbers:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the original number is 0, the representation is simply the character
		for 0 from the counter style's table, below.  End this algorithm.</li>

		<li>Split the decimal number into groups of four digits, starting with 
		the least significant digit.</li>

		<li>Ignoring groups that have the value 0, append the second group marker 
		to the second group, the third group marker to the third group, and the 
		fourth group marker to the fourth group.  The first group has no marker.</li>

		<li>For each group, ignoring digits that have the value 0, append the 
		second digit marker to the second digit, the third digit marker to the 
		third digit, and the fourth digit marker to the fourth digit. The first 
		digit has no marker.</li>

		<li>If the second, third, or fourth digit of any group was a 1, remove
		the 1 (leave the digit marker).  If any digit was a 0, remove it.</li>

		<li>Concatenate the groups back into a single string, least significant
		group first (on the right).</li>

		<li>Replace each digit with the relevant character from the counter style's
		table, below.</li>
	</ol>

	styles:</p>

	<p>This property sets the image that will be used as the list item marker. When 
	the <b>&lt;image></b> resolves to a valid image, it is used as the default contents 
	of ''::marker'' instead of the value specified by 'list-style-type'.</p>

	<p>If the value ''none'' is provided, or the <b>&lt;image></b> doesn't resolve 
	to a valid image, then the default contents are given by 'list-style-type' instead.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>The following example sets the marker at the beginning of each list item to

List Content: Generating the computed value of the 'content' property</h2>

	<p>If a ''::marker'' pseudo-element has its 'content' property set to ''normal'', the 
	following algorithm should be used to generate the computed value of the property.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>If the computed value of 'list-style-image' is not ''none'', and if the 
		image is valid, then the computed value of the 'content' property is the value 
		of the 'list-style-image' property.</li>

		<li>Otherwise, if the computed value of 'list-style-type' is a string, then 
		the computed value of the 'content' property is that string.</li>

		<li>Otherwise, if the computed value of 'list-style-type' is not ''none'', then
		the computed value of the 'content' property is ''counter(list-item, <b>&lt;counter-style></b>)'', 
		where <b>&lt;counter-style></b> is the computed value of the 'list-style-type' 
		property, followed by a string that is the suffix for the counter style in question 
		(which may be empty).</li>

		<li>Otherwise the computed value is ''none''.</li>
	</ol>

	<div class="example">
		<p>Given the following style sheet:</p>
		<pre>
li { display: list-item; list-style-type: decimal /* initial value */; }
li::marker { content: normal /* initial value */; }

		<p>And the following document fragment:</p>

	<p>This property specifies the position of the ''::marker'' pseudo-element's box 
	in the list item. Values have the following meanings:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>inside</dfn></dt>
		<dd>The ''::marker'' pseudo-element is an inline-block element placed immediately
		before the ''::before'' pseudo-element in the list item's principle box, after 
		which the element's content flows. Note that if there is no inline content, 
		this will create a line box, just as content in an inline ''::before'' pseudo-element 
		would. Also note that all the properties that apply to inline elements apply 
		to the ''::marker'' pseudo-element in this state, and this ''::marker'' box 
		participates in the inline box model in the normal manner.</dd>

		<dt><dfn>hanging</dfn></dt>
		<dd>As ''inside'', except the marker is absolutely positioned.  The marker's 
		static position is such that its baseline is aligned with the baseline
		of the first line box in the list item, and its "end" edge is flush with 
		the "start" edge of the first line box in the list item.  
		<span class=note>Note that, per the Positioned Layout spec, absolutely positioned
		boxes leave behind a 'placeholder' in their original position in the box tree, 
		which may have an effect on line-box generation.</span></dd>

		<dt><dfn>outside</dfn></dt>
		<dd>As ''inside'', except the marker is absolutely positioned and has the same
		directionality as the list item's parent box.   The marker's static position is such that 
		its "over" edge is flush with the edge of the list item corresponding with
		the "over" edge of the list item's parent box, and it's "end" edge is 
		flush with the edge fo the list item corresponding to the "start" edge of the
		list item's parent box.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p class=issue>Are the positioning rules for ''hanging'' and ''outside'' good?</p>

	<p>Note that a marker is only generated if the computed value of the 'content' 
	property for the element's ''::marker'' pseudo-element is not ''none''.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p>For example:

		<pre class=html-example>
&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
  &lt;title>Comparison of inside/outside position&lt;/title>
  &lt;style>
   ul         { list-style: outside; }
   ul.compact { list-style: inside; }
  &lt;/style>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;ul>
   &lt;li>first list item comes first&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>second list item comes second&lt;/li>
  &lt;/ul>
  &lt;ul class=compact>
   &lt;li>first list item comes first&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>second list item comes second&lt;/li>
  &lt;/ul>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
		</pre>

		<p>The above example may be formatted as:</p>

		<div class="figure">
			<p><img id="img-list-inout" src="list-inout.gif" alt="list with bullets to the left of it and list with bullets inside"></p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>In right-to-left text, the markers would have been on the right side of the box.</p>

The 'list-style' shorthand property</h2>

	<table class="propdef">
		<tr>
			<th>Name:
			<td><dfn>list-style</dfn>
		<tr>
			<th>Value:
			<td>&lt;'list-style-type'> || &lt;'list-style-position'> || &lt;'list-style-image'>
		<tr>
			<th>Initial:
			<td>N/A (shorthand property)
		<tr>
			<th>Applies To:
			<td>all elements with ''display: list-item''
		<tr>
			<th>Media:
			<td>visual
		<tr>
			<th>Computed Value;
			<td>N/A (shorthand property)
	</table>

	<p>The 'list-style' property is a shorthand notation for setting the
	three properties 'list-style-type', 'list-style-image', and 'list-style-position'
	at the same place in the style sheet.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p>For example:</p>

		<pre>
UL { list-style: upper-roman inside }  /* Any UL */
UL > UL { list-style: circle outside } /* Any UL child of a UL */
</pre>
	</div>

	<p>Although authors may specify 'list-style' information directly on
	list item elements (e.g., LI in HTML), they should do so with care. The following rules look
	similar, but the first declares a descendant selector and the second a (more specific) child selector.</p>

	<pre class="example">
	OL.alpha LI   { list-style: lower-alpha } /* Any LI descendant of an OL */
	OL.alpha > LI { list-style: lower-alpha } /* Any LI child of an OL */
		</pre>

	<p>Authors who use only the descendant selector may not
	achieve the results they expect. Consider the following rules:</p>

	<pre class="html-example">
&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
  &lt;title>WARNING: Unexpected results due to cascade&lt;/title>
  &lt;style>
    ol.alpha li { list-style: lower-alpha; }
    ul li       { list-style: disc; }
  &lt;/style>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;ol class=alpha>
   &lt;li>level 1
    &lt;ul>
     &lt;li>level 2&lt;/li>
    &lt;/ul>
   &lt;/li>
  &lt;/ol>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
	</pre>

	<p>The desired rendering would have level 1 list items with 'lower-alpha' labels and level 2 items
	with 'disc' labels. However, the cascading order will cause the first style rule (which includes
	specific class information) to mask the second. The following rules solve the problem by employing a
	child selector instead:</p>

	<pre class="example">
OL.alpha > LI   { list-style: lower-alpha }
UL LI           { list-style: disc }
</pre>

	<p>Another solution would be to specify 'list-style' information only
	on the list type elements:

	<pre class="example">
OL.alpha   { list-style: lower-alpha }
UL         { list-style: disc }
</pre>

	<p>Inheritance will transfer the 'list-style' values from OL and UL
	elements to LI elements. This is the recommended way to specify list style information.</p>

	<div class="example">
		<p> A URI value may be combined with any other value, as in:</p>

		<pre>
UL { list-style: url("http://png.com/ellipse.png") disc }
</pre>
		<p> In the example above, the 'disc' will be used when the image is unavailable.</p>
	</div>

	<p>A value of ''none'' for the 'list-style' property sets both 'list-style-type' 
	and 'list-style-image' to ''none'', because it sets the 'list-style-type' to ''none'' 
	(that is the first value in the list), and the initial value of the 'list-style-image'
	property, which isn't listed in that declaration, is ''none''. For this reason,</p>

	<pre>LI { list-style: none; }</pre>

	<p>will ensure that no list-item marker is displayed on LI elements, except if a value is explicitly
	given to the 'content' property of the ''::marker'' pseudo-element. In general, the best way to ensure that no marker
	is rendered is to not set the 'display' property to list-item.</p>

<!-- ====================================================================== -->

<h2 id='marker-pseudoelement'>
Markers: The ''::marker'' pseudo-element</h2>

	<p>Markers are created by setting an element's 'display' property to
	''list-item''. The ''list-item'' display type is, in every
	other respect, identical to the ''block'' display type.  The marker box is only 
	created if the computed value of the 'content' property for the pseudo-element 
	is not ''none''.</p>

	<p>Just like other generated content, markers generate a box when they're created,
	which has margins, border, padding, and everything else a box normally has.  Markers
	are placed at the beginning of their superior parent's content, immediately before
	a ''::before'' pseudo-element on the same superior parent.  Marker boxes are 
	inline-block by default, and so a value of ''auto'' for 'width'
	resolves to the width of the marker's content.  The value of 'list-style-position'
	on the marker's superior parent can vary the marker's directionality and the
	initial value of its ''position'' property.</p>

	<div class="html-example">
		<p>In the following example, the content is centered within a marker
		box of a fixed width. This document:</p>

		<pre class=html-example>
&lt;!doctype html>
&lt;html>
 &lt;head>
  &lt;title>Content alignment in the marker box&lt;/title>
  &lt;style>
   LI::marker { 
     content: "(" counter(counter) ")";
     width: 6em;
     text-align: center;
   }
   LI {
     display: list-item;
     counter-increment: counter;
   }
  &lt;/style>
 &lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;ol>
   &lt;li>This is the first item.&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>This is the second item.&lt;/li>
   &lt;li>This is the third item.&lt;/li>
  &lt;/ol>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
		</pre>

		<p>should render something like this: </p>

		<pre>
  (1)    This is the 
         first item.
  (2)    This is the 
         second item.
  (3)    This is the 
         third item.
		</pre>

<h2 id='counter-style'>
Defining Custom Counter Styles: the ''@counter-style'' rule</h2>

	<p>CSS 2.1 defined a handful of useful counter styles based on the styles that
	HTML traditionally allowed on ordered and unordered lists.  This tiny set, though,
	is quite inadequate for modern web pages; displaying an ordered list with markers 
	based on the latin alphabet while the content is Arabic seems quite incongruous!</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, the set of potentially useful list styles is too large to
	specify ahead-of-time - the world contains thousands of languages and hundreds
	of scripts, not to mention the near-infinite stylistic variations found on the
	web that go beyond mere languaged-based variation.  The ''@counter-style'' rule
	allows CSS to address this in an open-ended manner, by allowing the author
	to define their own counter styles.  These styles can then be used in the
	'list-style-type' property or in the ''counter()'' and ''counters()'' functions,
	exactly like the predefined counter styles in CSS.</p>

<h3 id='counter-style-syntax'>
@counter-style Syntax</h3>

	<p>The ''@counter-style'' rule is defined as:</p>

	<pre class=prod>
@counter-style &lt;counter-style-name> {
	type:
	range:
	glyphs:
	additive-glyphs:
	cjk-glyphs:
	prefix:
	suffix:
	fallback:
}
	</pre>

	<p class=issue>Copy the way other specs define new @-rules that contain decl
	blocks, like @font-face.</p>

	<p>The &lt;counter-style-name> must be be a valid identifier, and must not be
	''decimal''; violating these rules is a syntax error and must cause the @counter-style
	block to be ignored.</p>

	<p>Omitting the 'type' property in a @counter-style block is a syntax error
	and must cause the @counter-style block to be ignored.  A @counter-style block
	must contain exactly one of 'glyphs', 'additive-glyphs', or 'cjk-glyphs'; containing
	none of them or more than one of them is a syntax error and must cause the 
	@counter-style block to be ignored.  Further, which of those three is present
	must match the 'type' value: if the type is ''additive'', the 'additive-glyphs'
	property must be present; if the type is ''cjk'', the 'cjk-glyphs' property
	must be present; if the type is any other valid type, the 'glyphs' property
	must be present.  Violating any of the conditions in the preceding sentence
	is a syntax error and must cause the @counter-style block to be ignored.
	Individual types may impose additional requirements on the value of the 'glyphs'
	property; if so, violating these requirements is a syntax error and must cause
	the @counter-style block to be ignored.</p>

	<p>The meaning and values of each of the properties are defined in the following
	section.</p>

<h4 id='counter-style-type'>
The 'type' Property</h4>

	<p>The 'type' property specifies which algorithm will be used to construct
	the counter's representation based on the counter value.  For example, ''repeating''
	type counter styles just cycle through their glyphs repeatedly, while ''numeric''
	type counter styles interpret their glyphs as digits and build their representation
	accordingly.  It is defined as:

	<pre class=prod>
&lt;counter-type> = repeating | numeric | alphabetic | symbolic | [ non-repeating &lt;integer>? ] | cjk | additive
	</pre>

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn>repeating</dfn></dt>
		<dd>
			<p>If the type is ''repeating'', the 'glyphs' property must contain 
			at least one <i>counter glyph</i>. This type is defined over all counter 
			values.</p>

			<p>The ''repeating'' counter type cycles repeatedly through its provided
			glyphs, looping back to the beginning when it falls off the end of the

			<i>counter glyph</i>), or for cycling through multiple bullets.  The 
			first <i>counter glyph</i> is used as the representation of the value 
			1, the second <i>counter glyph</i> (if it exists) is used as the representation
			of the value 2, etc.</p>

			<p>In general, if there are <code>N</code> <i>counter glyphs</i> and
			a representation is being constructed for the value <code>I</code>, 
			the representation is the <i>counter glyph</i> at index <code>I mod N</code>
			of the list of <i>counter glyphs</i> (indexed from 0). 
			<span class=note>The <code>mod</code> must return a non-negative number
			for these purposes.  If an implementation of <code>mod</code> returns
			a negative value for negative inputs, add <code>N</code> to the resultant
			value to make it non-negative.</span></p>

			<div class=example>
				<p>A 'triangle bullet' list style can be defined with code like:</p>

				<pre>
@counter-style triangle {

			<p>When this type is specified, it may optionally have an integer provided

			<p>The ''non-repeating'' counter type is for representing counter styles

			<p>If the type is ''additive'', the 'additive-glyphs' property must

			<p>The ''additive'' counter type can be used to implement roman numerals,

			<p>To construct the representation, let <var>I</var> initially be the

			<var>glyph list</var> initially be the list of <i>additive tuple</i>s.

			<p>If the loop ended because <var>I</var> is 0, return S.  If the loop

<h3 id='counter-style-range'>
The 'range' property</h3>

	<p>The 'range' property defines the range over which the counter style is defined.
	If a counter style is used to represent a counter value outside of its range,
	the counter style instead drops down to its fallback counter style.  The property
	is defined as:</p>

	<pre class=prod>
&lt;counter-range> = [&lt;integer> | infinite]{2}
	</pre>

	<p>The first value represents the lower bound of the range (with 'infinite'
	representing negative infinity), and the second value represents the upper bound
	of the range (with 'infinite' representing positive infinity).  This is an inclusive
	range - it includes both the lower and upper bound numbers.  It is a syntax
	error for the lower bound to be higher than the upper bound, and must cause
	the @counter-style block to be ignored.</p>

	<p>Some counter style types have their own implicit ranges, specified above 
	in the individual descriptions for each type.  The range specified by the 'range'
	property is applied after the implicit type-based range, and can only tighten
	the range (that is, make the lower bound higher or the upper bound lower).  
	It is not an error to specify a 'range' value larger than the implicit range;
	the part of the range outside the implicit range simply has no effect.</p>

<h3 id='counter-style-glyphs'>
The 'glyphs' property</h3>

	<p>The 'glyphs' property specifies the <i>counter glyph</i>s used by several
	of the counter style types to construct their representations.  It is defined
	as:</p>

	<pre class=prod>
&lt;counter-glyphs> = [ &lt;string> | &lt;image> ]+
	</pre>

	<p>Some counter style types specify that the 'glyphs' property must have at 
	least two entries.  If the counter style's type is set to such a type, it is
	a syntax error to have less than two entries in the 'glyphs' property and must
	cause the @counter-style block to be ignored.</p>

	<p>Each entry in the 'glyphs' property is a <dfn>counter glyph</dfn>.</p>

	<div class=example>
		<p class=issue>Add example of string glyphs.</p>
		<p class=issue>Add example of image glyphs.</p>
	</div>

<h3 id='counter-style-prefix'>
The 'prefix' property</h3>

	<p>The 'prefix' property specifies a string that is placed before the representation
	of the counter value when constructing the default contents of the ::marker
	pseudo-element.  It is defined as:</p>

	<pre class=prod>
&lt;counter-prefix> = &lt;string>
	</pre>

	<p>If the 'prefix' property is omitted or invalid, its initial value is "" 
	(the empty string).</p>

<h3 id='counter-style-suffix'>
The 'suffix' property</h3>

	<p>The 'suffix' property specifies a string that is placed after the representation
	of the counter value when constructing the default contents of the ::marker
	pseudo-element.  It is defined as:</p>

	<pre class=prod>
&lt;counter-suffix> = &lt;string>
	</pre>

	<p>If the 'suffix' property is omitted or invalid, its initial value is "." 
	U+002E FULL STOP.</p>

<h3 id='counter-style-fallback'>
The 'fallback' property</h3>

	<p>The 'fallback' property specifies a fallback counter style.  When the
	given counter style cannot generate a representation for a counter value (for
	example, if the counter value is outside the range for the counter style), the
	representation is instead generated by the fallback counter style.  It is defined
	as:</p>

	<pre class=prod>
&lt;counter-style-fallback> = &lt;counter-style-name>
	</pre>

	<p>If the 'fallback' property is omitted, invalid, or refers to a non-existent
	counter style, its initial value is 'decimal' (which is guaranteed to be defined).</p>

Appendix A: Required Predefined Counter Styles</h2>

	<p>While this specification defines a mechanism to allow authors to define

	styles every time they are used would be unnecessarily onerous.  To aid in this
	regard, this specification predefines a large set of counter styles.  User agents 
	must include the following stylesheet as a user-agent stylesheet, so authors 
	can depend on these styles being present.</p>

	<p>As with any ''@counter-style'' rule, the counter style definitions given

	<p class=issue>Per <a href="http://www.ethiopic.org/w3c/css/WD-css3-lists-20020220-comments.html#copticlists">http://www.ethiopic.org/w3c/css/WD-css3-lists-20020220-comments.html#armenianlists</a>, we should have upper-coptic, lower-coptic, and coptic-numeric styles.  The Coptic script was split out in Unicode 4.1 to occupy the block from U+2C80 to U+2CFF.  Which characters should I use for each?</p>

	<p class=issue>Per <a href="http://www.ethiopic.org/w3c/css/WD-css3-lists-20020220-comments.html#armenianlists">http://www.ethiopic.org/w3c/css/WD-css3-lists-20020220-comments.html#armenianlists</a>, putting the circumflex above a digit in armenian numbering multiplies the digit by 1000.  The draft currently states a 10,000 multiplier.  Which is correct? (Having the multiplier be 1000 means that you can potentially write the thousands digit two ways, using either the set of thousands digits or the set of ones digits with a circumflex.  The examples given in the note appear to use the former.)</p>

Changes From CSS2</h2>

	<p>As described in the introduction section, there are significant changes in this module when
	compared to CSS2.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>''display:marker'' has been replaced with ''::marker''</li>

		<li>It is no longer possible to make end markers.</li>

		<li>The 'marker-offset' property is obsoleted.</li>

		<li>Markers are now aligned relative to the line box edge, rather than the border edge.</li>

		<li>Markers now have margins.</li>

		<li>The introduction of many new list style types as well as explicit algorithms for all list style types.</li>

		<li>Error handling rules for unknown list style types were changed to be consistent with the normal
		 parsing error handling rules.</li>

		<li>The list-item predefined counter identifier has been introduced.</li>
	</ol>
