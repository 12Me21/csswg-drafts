    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that describes the rendering of markup documents
      (e.g. HTML, XML) on various supports, such as screen, paper, speech, etc. The Speech module
      defines aural CSS properties that enable authors to declaratively control the rendering of
      documents via speech synthesis, and using optional audio cues. The feature set exposed by this
      specification is designed to match the model described by the Speech Synthesis Markup Language
      (SSML) Version 1.1 [[!SSML]]. Note that this standard was developed in cooperation with the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/">Voice Browser Activity</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="design-goals">Design goals, motivations</h3>
    <p>The aural rendering of a document combines speech synthesis (also known as "TTS", the acronym
      for "Text to Speech") and auditory icons (which we refer to as "audio cues" in this
      specification). The aural presentation of information is common amongst communities of users
      who are blind or visually-impaired. For instance, "screen readers" enable control of visual
      user-interfaces that would otherwise be inaccessible. There are other cases whereby listening
      to textual information (as opposed to reading it) is a necessity. Typical examples include
      in-car use of an e-book reader, industrial and medical documentation systems, home
      entertainment, helping users to learn reading, or supporting users who have reading
      difficulties (print disabilities). </p>
    <p> When it comes to documents, the quality of the speech rendition depends on the structure and
      semantics authored within the content itself. The CSS Speech module provides properties that
      enable authors to declaratively control presentational aspects of the aural dimension (e.g.
      TTS voice, pitch, rate, and volume levels). These style sheet properties can be used together
      with visual properties (mixed media), or as a complete aural alternative to a visual
      presentation.</p>
    <p> Content creators can conditionally include CSS properties dedicated to user-agents with text
      to speech synthesis capabilities, by specifying the "speech" media type via the
        <code>media</code> attribute of the <code>link</code> element, or with the
        <code>@media</code> at-rule, or within an <code>@import</code> statement. When doing so, the
      styles authored within the scope of such conditional statements are ignored by user-agents
      that do not support this module. </p>
    <h3 id="css21-rel">Relationship with CSS2.1</h3>
    <p> The CSS Speech module is a re-work of the informative CSS2.1 Aural appendix, within which
      the "aural" media type was described, but also deprecated (in favor of the "speech" media
      type). Although the [[!CSS21]] specification reserves the "speech" media type, it doesn't
      actually define the corresponding properties. This module describes the CSS properties that
      apply to the "speech" media type, and defines a new "box" model specifically for the aural
      dimension. </p>
    <h2 id="values">CSS values</h2>
    <p>This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs"
        >CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in this
      specification are defined in CSS Value and Units Level 3 [[!CSS3VAL]]. </p>
    <p>In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties
      defined in this specification also accept the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a> keyword as
      their property value. For readability it has not been repeated explicitly. </p>
    <h2 id="example">Example</h2>
    <div class="example">
      <p>This example shows how authors can tell the speech synthesizer to speak HTML headings with
        a voice called "paul", using "moderate" emphasis (which is more than normal) and how to
        insert an audio cue (prerecorded audio clip located at the given URL) before the start of
        TTS rendering for each heading. In a stereo-capable sound system, paragraphs marked with the
        CSS class "heidi" are rendered on the left audio channel (and with a female voice, etc.),
        whilst the class "peter" corresponds to the right channel (and to a male voice, etc.). The
        volume level of text spans marked with the class "special" is lower than normal, and a
        prosodic boundary is created by introducing a strong pause after it is spoken (note how the
          <code>span</code> inherits the voice-family from its parent paragraph).</p>
      <pre>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
{
  voice-family: paul;
  voice-stress: moderate;
  cue-before: url(../audio/ping.wav);
  voice-volume: medium 6dB;
}
p.heidi
{
  voice-family: female;
  voice-balance: left;
  voice-pitch: high;
  voice-volume: -6dB;
}
p.peter
{
  voice-family: male;
  voice-balance: right;
  voice-rate: fast;
}
span.special
{
  voice-volume: soft;
  pause-after: strong;
}

...

&lt;h1&gt;I am Paul, and I speak headings.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="heidi"&gt;Hello, I am Heidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="peter"&gt;
  &lt;span class="special"&gt;Can you hear me ?&lt;/span&gt;
  I am Peter.
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <h2 id="aural-model">The aural formatting model</h2>
    <p>The CSS formatting model for aural media is based on a sequence of sounds and silences that
      occur within a nested context similar to the <a href="#box-model-def">visual box model</a>,
      which we name the <dfn id="aural-box-model">aural "box" model</dfn>. The aural "canvas"
      consists of a two-channel (stereo) space and of a temporal dimension, within which synthetic
      speech and audio cues coexist. The selected element is surrounded by 'rest', 'cue' and 'pause'
      properties (from the innermost to the outermost position). These can be seen as aural
      equivalents to 'padding', 'border' and 'margin', respectively. When used, the ':before' and
      ':after' pseudo-elements [[!CSS21]] get inserted between the element's contents and the
      'rest'. </p>
    <p> The following diagram illustrates the equivalence between properties of the visual and aural
      box models, applied to the selected &lt;element&gt;:</p>

    <p>The 'voice-volume' property manipulates the amplitude of the audio waveform generated by the
      speech synthesiser, and is also used when calculating the relative volume level of <a
        href="#cue-props">audio cues</a> within the <a href="#aural-model">audio "box" model</a>. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the functionality provided by this property is related to the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/#edef_prosody"><code>volume</code> attribute

      <dd>
        <p> Specifies that no sound is generated (the text is read "silently"). Corresponds to
          negative infinity in dB units.</p>
        <p class="note"> Note that there is a difference between an element whose 'voice-volume'
          property has a value of 'silent', and an element whose 'speak' property has the value
          'none'. With the former, the selected element takes up the same time as if it was spoken,
          including any pause before and after the element, but no sound is generated (descendants
          can override the 'voice-volume' value and may therefore generate audio output). With the
          latter, the selected element is not rendered in the aural dimension and no time is
          allocated for playback (descendants can override the 'speak' value and may therefore
          generate audio output). </p>

        <p> This sequence of keywords corresponds to monotonically non-decreasing volume levels,
          mapped to implementation-dependent values (i.e. inferred by the user-agent) that meet the
          user's requirements in terms of perceived sound loudness . The keyword 'x-soft' maps to
          the user's <em>minimum audible</em> volume level, 'x-loud' maps to the user's <em>maximum
            tolerable</em> volume level, 'medium' maps to the user's <em>preferred</em> volume
          level, 'soft' and 'loud' map to intermediary values. </p>

        <p>A <a href="#number-def">number</a> immediately followed by "dB" (decibel unit). This
          represents a change (positive or negative) relative to the given keyword value (see
          enumeration above), or to the default value for the root element, or otherwise to the
          inherited volume level (which may itself be be a combination of a keyword value and of a
          decibel offset). When the inherited volume level is 'silent', this 'voice-volume' resolves
          to 'silent' too, regardless of the provided &lt;decibel&gt; value. Decibels express the
          ratio of the squares of the new signal amplitude (a1) and the current amplitude (a0), as
          per the following logarithmic equation: volume(dB) = 20 log10 (a1 / a0) </p>
        <p class="note"> Note that -6.0dB is approximately half the amplitude of the audio signal,
          and +6.0dB is approximately twice the amplitude.</p>

    <p class="note">Note that the actual perceived volume levels depend on various factors, such as
      the listening environment and personal user preferences. The effective volume variation
      between 'x-soft' and 'x-loud' represents the dynamic range (in terms of loudness) of the
      speech output. Typically, this range would be compressed in a noisy context, i.e. the
      perceived loudness corresponding to 'x-soft' would effectively be closer to 'x-loud' than it
      would be in a quiet environment. There may also be situations where both 'x-soft' and 'x-loud'
      would map to low volume levels, such as in listening environments requiring discretion (e.g.
      library, night-reading). </p>

    <p> The 'voice-balance' property controls the spatial distribution of audio output across a
      lateral sound stage: one extremity is on the left, the other extremity is on the right hand
      side, relative to the listener's position. Authors can specify intermediary steps between left
      and right extremities, to represent the audio separation along the resulting left-right axis. </p>

    <p class="note"> Note that the functionality provided by this property has no match in the SSML
      markup language [[!SSML]]. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> When user-agents produce audio via a mono-aural sound system (i.e. single-speaker setup),
        the 'voice-balance' property has no effect. </li>
      <li> When user-agents produce audio through a stereo sound system (e.g. two speakers, a pair
        of headphones), the left-right distribution of audio signals precisely match the authored
        values for the 'voice-balance' property. </li>
      <li> When user-agents are capable of mixing audio signals through more than 2 channels (e.g.
        5-speakers surround sound system, including a dedicated center channel), the physical
        distribution of audio signals resulting from the application of the 'voice-balance' property
        must be performed so that the listener perceives sound as if it was coming from a basic
        stereo layout. For example, the center channel as well as the left/right speakers may be
        used altogether in order to emulate the behavior of the 'center' value (zero, on the
        [-100,100] scale of the 'voice-balance' property). </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note"> Note that sound systems may be configured by users in such a way that it would
      interfere with the left-right audio distribution specified by document authors. Typically, the
      various "surround" modes available in modern sound systems (including systems based on basic
      stereo speakers) tend to greatly alter the perceived spatial arrangement of audio signals.
      Some users may even configure their system to "downgrade" any rendered sound to a single mono
      channel, in which case the effect of the 'voice-balance' property would obviously not be
      perceivable at all. The rendering fidelity of authored content is therefore dependent on such
      user customizations. </p>

      one value is given, it applies to both properties.</p>

    <h3 id="collapsing">Collapsing pauses</h3>
    <p> The pause defines the minimum distance of the aural "box" to the aural "boxes" before and
      after it. Adjoining pauses are merged by selecting the strongest named break and the longest
      absolute time interval. For example, "strong" is selected when comparing "strong" and "weak",
      "1s" is selected when comparing "1s" and "250ms", and "strong" and "250ms" take effect
      additively when comparing "strong" and "250ms". </p>
    <p>The following pauses are adjoining:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-after' of its last child, provided the
        former has no 'rest-after' and no 'cue-after'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its first child, provided
        the former has no 'rest-before' and no 'cue-before'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its next sibling.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' and 'pause-after' of an aural "box", if the the "box" has a
        'voice-duration' of "0ms" and no 'rest-before' or 'rest-after' and no 'cue-before' or
        'cue-after', or if the the "box" has no rendered content at all (see 'speak').</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A collapsed pause is considered adjoining to another pause if any of its component pauses is
      adjoining to that pause.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that 'pause' has been moved from between the element's contents and any
      'cue' to outside the 'cue'. This is not backwards compatible with the informative CSS2.1 Aural
      appendix [[!CSS21]].</p>

          selection and language handling). This value behaves as 'inherit' when applied to the root
          element. </p>
        <p class="note"> Note that descendants of the selected element automatically inherit the
          'preserve' value, unless it is explicitly overridden by other 'voice-family' values (e.g.

    <h4 class="no-toc" id="voice-selection">Voice selection, content language</h4>
    <p>The 'voice-family' property is used to guide the selection of the speech synthesis voice
      instance. As part of this selection process, speech-capable user agents must also take into
      account the language of the selected element within the markup content. The "name", "gender",
      "age", and preferred "variant" (index) are voice selection hints that get carried down the
      content hierarchy as the 'voice-family' property value gets inherited by descendant elements.
      At any point within the content structure, the language takes precedence (i.e. has a higher
      priority) over the specified CSS voice characteristics. </p>
    <p> The following list outlines the voice selection algorithm (note that the definition of
      "language" is loose here, in order to cater for dialectic variants):</p>
    <ol>
      <li> If only a single voice instance is available for the language of the selected content,
        then this voice must be used, regardless of the specified CSS voice characteristics. </li>
      <li> If several voice instances are available for the language of the selected content, then
        the chosen voice is the one that most closely matches the specified name, or gender, age,
        and preferred voice variant. The actual definition of "best match" is processor-dependent
        (e.g. a reasonable match for "voice-family: 10 male;" may well be a higher-pitched female
        voice, as this tone of voice may be close to that of a young boy). If no voice instance
        matches the characteristics provided by any of the 'voice-family' component values, the
        first available voice instance (amongst those suitable for the language of the selected
        content) must be used. </li>
      <li> If no voice is available for the language of the selected content, it is recommended that
        user-agents let the user know about the lack of appropriate TTS voice. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The speech synthesizer voice must be re-evaluated (i.e. the selection process must take place
      once again) whenever any of the CSS voice characteristics change within the content flow. The
      voice must also be re-calculated whenever the content language changes, unless the 'preserve'
      keyword is used (this may be useful in cases where embedded foreign language text can be
      spoken using a voice not designed for this language, as demonstrated by the example
      below).</p>
    <p class="note">Note that dynamically computing a voice may lead to unexpected lag, so
      user-agents should try to resolve concrete voice instances in the document tree before the
      playback starts. </p>
    <div class="example">

    <p> The 'voice-duration' property specifies how long it should take to render the selected
      element's content (not including <a href="#cue-props">audio cues</a>, <a href="#pause-props">
        pauses</a> and <a href="#rest-props">rests</a> ). Unless the value 'auto' is specified, this
      property takes precedence over the 'voice-rate' property, and should be used to determine a
      suitable speaking rate for the voice. An element for which the 'voice-duration' property value
      is not 'auto' may have descendants for which the 'voice-duration' and 'voice-rate' properties
      are specified, but these must be ignored. In other words, when a 'time' is specified for the
      'voice-duration' of a selected element, it applies to the entire element subtree (children
      cannot override the property). </p>

    <p>The '<a href="#list-style-type-def">
        <code class="property">list-style-type</code></a>' property of [[!CSS21]] specifies three
      types of list item markers: glyphs, numbering systems, and alphabetic systems. The values
      allowed for this property are also used for the counter() function of the 'content' property.
      The CSS Speech module defines how to render these styles in the aural dimension, using speech
      synthesis. The '<a href="#list-style-image-def"><code class="property"
        >list-style-image</code></a>' property of [[!CSS21]] is ignored, and instead the '<a
        href="#list-style-type-def"><code class="property">list-style-type</code></a>' is used. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the speech rendering of new features from the CSS Lists and Counters
      Module Level 3 [[CSS3LIST]] is not covered in this level of CSS Speech, but may be defined in
      a future specification.</p>

        <p> For these list item styles, the user-agent defines (possibly based on user preferences)
          what equivalent phrase is spoken or what audio cue is played. List items with graphical

        <p> For these list item styles, corresponding numbers are spoken as-is by the speech
          synthesizer, and may be complemented with additional audio cues or speech phrases in the
          document's language (i.e. with the same TTS voice used to speak the list item content) in
          order to indicate the presence of list items. For example, when using the English
          language, the list item counter could be prefixed with the word "Item", which would result
          in list items being announced with "Item one", "Item two", etc. </p>

        <p> These list item styles are spelled out letter-by-letter by the speech synthesizer, in
          the document language (i.e. with the same TTS voice used to speak the list item content).
          For example, 'lower-greek' in English would be read out as "alpha", "beta", "gamma", etc.
          Conversely, 'upper-latin' in French would be read out as /a/, /be/, /se/, etc. (phonetic
          notation) </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note">Note that it is common for user-agents such as screen readers to announce the
      nesting depth of list items, or more generally, to indicate additional structural information
      pertaining to complex hierarchical content. The verbosity of these additional audio cues
      and/or speech output can usually be controlled by users, and contribute to increasing
      usability. These navigation aids are implementation-dependent, but it is recommended that
      user-agents supporting the CSS Speech module ensure that these additional audio cues and
      speech output don't generate redundancies or create inconsistencies (for example: duplicated
      or different list item numbering scheme). </p>
    <h2 id="content">Inserted and replaced content</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is non-normative.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, authors will want to specify a mapping from the source text into another string
      prior to the application of the regular pronunciation rules. This may be used for uncommon
      abbreviations or acronyms which are unlikely to be recognized by the synthesizer. The
      'content' property can be used to replace one string by another. The functionality provided by
      this property is related to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/#edef_sub"
          ><code>alias</code> attribute of the <code>sub</code> element</a> from the SSML markup
      language [[!SSML]]. </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p> In this example, the abbreviation is rendered using the content of the title attribute
        instead of the element's content.</p>
      <pre>
/* This replaces the content of the selected element
by the string "World Wide Web Consortium". */
abbr { content: attr(title); }
...

&lt;abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium"&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>In a similar way, text strings in a document can be replaced by a previously recorded
      version.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>In this example - assuming the format is supported, the file is available and the UA is
        configured to do so - a recording of Sir John Gielgud's declamation of the famous monologue
        is played. Otherwise the UA falls back to render the text using synthesized speech. </p>
      <pre>
.hamlet { content: url(./audio/gielgud.wav); }
...

&lt;div class="hamlet"&gt;
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, authors (or users via a user stylesheet) may add some information to ease the
      understanding of structures during non-visual interaction with the document. They can do so by
      using the '::before' and '::after' pseudo-elements. Note that different stylesheets can be
      used to define the level of verbosity for additional information spoken by screen readers.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>This example inserts the string "Start list: " before a list and the string "List item: "
        before the content of each list item. Likewise, the string "List end: " gets inserted after
        the list to inform the user that the list speech output is over.</p>
      <pre>
ul::before { content: "Start list: "; }
ul::after  { content: "List end. "; }
li::before { content: "List item: "; }</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Detailed information can be found in the CSS3 Generated and Replaced Content module
      [[CSS3GENCON]].</p>
    <h2 id="pronunciation"> Pronunciation, phonemes </h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is non-normative.</p>
    <p> CSS does not specify how to define the pronunciation (expressed using a well-defined
      phonetic alphabet) of a particular piece of text within the markup document. A "phonemes"
      property was described in earlier drafts of this specification, but objections were raised due
      to breaking the principle of separation between content and presentation (the "phonemes"
      authored within aural CSS stylesheets would have needed to be updated each time text changed
      within the markup document). The "phonemes" functionality is therefore considered out-of-scope
      in CSS (the presentation layer) and should be addressed in the markup / content layer.</p>
    <p> The <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-pronunciation">"pronunciation"</a>
      <code>rel</code> value allows importing pronunciation lexicons in HTML documents using the
        <code>link</code> element (similar to how CSS stylesheets can be included). The W3C PLS
      (Pronunciation Lexicon Specification) [[PRONUNCIATION-LEXICON]] is one format that can be used
      to describe such a lexicon.</p>
    <p> Additionally, an attribute-based mechanism can be used within the markup to author
      text-pronunciation associations. At the time of writing, such mechanism isn't formally defined
      in the W3C HTML standard(s). However, the <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30">EPUB 3.0 draft
        specification</a> allows (x)HTML5 documents to contain attributes derived from the [[!SSML]]
      specification, that describe how to pronounce text based on a particular phonetic
      alphabet.</p>
    <!-- p> 
      One avenue to explore is the use CSS to "bind" HTML text with a   
      phoneme (also declared in the HTML document). This would maintain a   
      clear separation between content and presentation, and it would allow   
      authors to define different pronunciations for one given text token   
      (Media Queries could drive the switch of stylesheet to import). This   
      possibility has been mentioned several times by Working Group members   
      as well as people from the public mailing-list, so it cannot be   
      ignored. However, there are architectural considerations (e.g.   
      collision between CSS versus HTML -defined phonemes) which make this a   
      lot trickier to standardize than it sounds. The   
      whole "speech synthesis" issue should be tackled globally at the level   
      of the W3C ecosystem. For example, there are many cross-cutting   
      concerns with the work done by the HTML-Audio and HTML-Speech   
      Incubator Groups.

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. However, for readability, these words

      CSS3 Speech module by parsing them correctly and rendering the document accordingly. However
      the inability of a UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device does not
      make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not required to render color on a monochrome

    <h3 class="no-num" id="exit">CR exit criteria</h3>
    <p>As described in the W3C process document, a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">Candidate Recommendation</a>
      (CR) is a specification that W3C recommends for use on the Web. The next stage is
      "Recommendation" when the specification is sufficiently implemented.</p>
    <p>For this specification to be proposed as a W3C Recommendation, the following conditions shall
      be met. There must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature.
      Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products, there is no requirement that
      all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define
      the following terms: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>independent</dt>
      <dd>each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse, or
        derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that have no
        bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from this requirement.</dd>
      <dt>interoperable</dt>
      <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the official CSS test suite, or, if the
        implementation is not a Web browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
        suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user agent (UA) is to be used to
        claim interoperability. In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
        then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those equivalent tests in the
        same way for the purpose of interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
        available for the purposes of peer review.</dd>
      <dt>implementation</dt>
      <dd>a user agent which: <ol class="inline">
          <li>implements the specification.</li>
          <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may be a shipping product or
            other publicly available version (i.e., beta version, preview release, or "nightly
            build"). Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the feature(s) for a period
            of at least one month in order to demonstrate stability.</li>
          <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed to pass the test suite and
            is not intended for normal usage going forward).</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A minimum of sixth months of the CR period must have elapsed. This is to ensure that enough
      time is given for any remaining major errors to be caught. </p>
    <p>Features will be dropped if two or more interoperable implementations are not found by the
      end of the CR period. </p>
    <p>Features may/will also be dropped if adequate/sufficient (by judgment of CSS WG) tests have
      not been produced for those feature(s) by the end of the CR period. </p>
    <h2 class="no-num" id="changes">Appendix D &mdash; Changes from previous draft</h2>
    <p> Note that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-speech-20110419">previous Working
        Draft</a> includes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-speech-20110419#changes">its
        own list of changes</a>, which - for succinctness - is not repeated here. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed the "phonemes" property (and its associated "@alphabet" at-rule).</li>
      <li>Renamed 'speakability' to 'speak', and 'speak' to 'speak-as'. Reorganized the 'speak-as'
        values to allow mixing different types.</li>
      <li>Added support for lists and counters (item styles, numbering, etc.).</li>
      <li>Adjusted the [initial] value for shorthand properties, to be consistent with other CSS
        specifications (i.e. "see individual properties"), and removed the erroneous "inherit"
        value.</li>
      <li>Fixed 'voice-volume' by conforming to SSML 1.1 (dB scale, etc.).</li>
      <li>Fixed the [initial] values for 'pause' and 'rest', which should be zero (were
        "implementation-dependent").</li>
      <li>Corrected the [initial] values for 'voice-pitch-range' and 'voice-pitch' to "medium".</li>
      <li>Added an "auto" value to 'voice-duration', which is the [initial] property value as
        well.</li>
      <li>Handling of 'voice-balance' values outside of the allowed range (clamping).</li>
      <li>Added the 'normal' value for voice-rate ("default" in SSML 1.1).</li>
      <li>Renamed voice-family fields to be consistent with SSML.</li>
      <li>Improved the 'voice-family' selection algorithm to cater for language changes.</li>
      <li>Separated definition of semitones, as they are relative values already (unlike Hz
        frequencies).</li>
      <li>More consistent behavior when audio cue URI fails (for whatever reason).</li>
      <li>Enabled voice-family names to contain spaces, matching 'font-family' syntax which is based
        on quoted strings and concatenated identifiers.</li>
      <li>Added a new section to define the relationship of this specification with CSS2.1.</li>
      <li>Added the missing "Computed value" line to each property definition.</li>
      <li>Cleaned-up the list of module dependencies, and removed redundant "module dependencies"
        section.</li>
      <li> Voice age now expressed using integers rather than a keyword enumeration ('child',
        'young' and 'old'). This aligns with SSML. </li>
      <li>Improved the pause collapsing prose, removed redundant paragraphs.</li>
      <li>Added the missing 'normal' value for 'voice-stress'.</li>
      <li>Separated the 'relative' keyword for 'voice-pitch' and 'voice-range'.</li>
      <li>Improved document structure by adding sub-sections.</li>
      <li>Removed the implicit 'inherit' value for all properties.</li>
      <li>Fixed typos and made other minor edits.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- For reference only, changes in previous draft: -->
    <!-- ul>
            <li>Removed the "mark" property, see the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Feb/0029.html">Working Group resolution</a></li>
            <li>Added the 'speakability' property and removed the 'none' value of the 'speak' property,
            as per this <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jan/0483.html">discussion</a></li>
            <li>Fixed 'voice-family' grammar as per <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Dec/0231.html">this discussion</a></li>
            <li>The volume level of audio cues can only be set relatively to the inherited 'voice-volume' property (to avoid cues being spoken when the main element is silent, which contradicts the "aural box model").</li>
            <li>Added "HTML" to "CSS defines aural properties that give control over rendering
            XML to speech" in the abstract.</li>
            <li>Removed unused normative links to CSS3 modules (actually moved to informative references), now the only dependency is CSS3 Values and Units.</li>
            <li>Removed issue about the 'sub' SSML element given that the CSS "content" replacement functionality addresses the same requirement.</li>
            <li>Added support for semitones in pitch alterations.</li>
            <li>Added reference to "time" values syntax (s, ms) for 'voice-duration'.</li>
            <li>Moved "content" outside of "phonetics", as the ::before and ::after use-cases do not relate to pronunciation rules (this is actually more similar to audio cues, only applied with text rather than audio files)</li>
            <li>Added prose to explicitly support alphabet other than IPA, via the "x-" vendor-specific prefix.</li>
            <li>Reworked HTML source code to work with the <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/member-bin/process.cgi">members-only W3C pre-processor/generator</a></li>
            <li>Added note about the "speech" and "aural" media types.</li>
            <li>Harmonized all hyperlinks so that CSS properties get auto-linked by the pre-processor</li>
            <li>Clarified computation rules for positive percentages with "+" prefixes (i.e. they do not denote increments, the regular multiplicative behavior is used).</li>
            <li>Fixed IPA URL reference</li>
            <li>Reorganized appendixes</li>
            <li>Fixed minor typos</li>
