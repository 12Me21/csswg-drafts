    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language that describes the rendering of markup documents
      (e.g. HTML, XML) on various supports, such as screen, paper, speech, etc. The Speech Module
      defines aural CSS properties that enable authors to declaratively control the rendering of
      documents via speech synthesis, and using optional audio cues. The feature set exposed by this
      specification is designed to match the model described by the Speech Synthesis Markup Language
      (SSML) Version 1.0 [[!SPEECH-SYNTHESIS]]. Note that this standard was developed in cooperation
      with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Voice/">Voice Browser Activity</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="design-goals">Design goals, motivations</h3>
    <p>The aural rendering of a document combines speech synthesis (also known as "TTS", the acronym
      for "Text to Speech") and auditory icons (which we refer to as "audio cues" in this
      specification). The aural presentation of information is common amongst communities of users
      who are blind or visually-impaired. For instance, "screen readers" enable control of visual
      user-interfaces that would otherwise be inaccessible. There are other cases whereby listening
      to textual information (as opposed to reading it) is a necessity. Typical examples include
      in-car use of an e-book reader, industrial and medical documentation systems, home
      entertainment, helping users to learn reading, or supporting users who have reading
      difficulties (print disabilities). </p>
    <p> When it comes to documents, the quality of the speech rendition depends on the structure and
      semantics authored within the content itself. The CSS Speech Module provides properties that
      enable authors to declaratively control presentational aspects of the aural dimension (e.g.
      TTS voice, pitch, rate, volume levels, etc.). These style sheet properties can be used
      together with visual properties (mixed media), or as a complete aural alternative to visual
      presentation. The aural "canvas" consists of a two-channel (stereo) space and of a temporal
      dimension, within which synthetic speech and audio cues coexist.</p>
    <h3 id="css21-rel">Relationship with CSS2.1</h3>
    <p> The CSS Speech Module is a re-work of the informative CSS2.1 Aural appendix, within which
      the "aural" media type was described, but also deprecated (in favor of the "speech" media
      type). Although the [[!CSS21]] specification reserves the "speech" media type, it doesn't
      actually define the corresponding properties. This Module describes the CSS properties that
      apply to the "speech" media type, and defines a new "box" model specifically for the aural
      dimension. </p>
    <p> Note that content creators can conditionally include CSS properties dedicated to user-agents
      with text to speech synthesis capabilities, by specifying the "speech" media type via the
        <code>media</code> attribute of the <code>link</code> element, or with the
        <code>@media</code> at-rule, or within an <code>@import</code> statement. When doing so, the
      styles authored within the scope of such conditional statements are ignored by user-agents
      that do not support speech synthesis. </p>
    <h3 id="example">CSS Speech Example</h3>
    <p>The following example shows how authors can tell the speech synthesizer to speak HTML
      headings with a voice called "paul", using "moderate" emphasis (which is more than normal) and
      how to insert an audio cue (prerecorded audio clip located at the given URL) before the start
      of TTS rendering for each heading. In a stereo-capable sound system, paragraphs marked with
      the CSS class "heidi" are rendered on the left audio channel (and with a female voice, etc.),
      whilst the class "peter" corresponds to the right channel (and to a male voice, etc.). The
      volume level of text spans marked with the class "special" is lower than normal, and a
      prosodic boundary is created by introducing a strong pause after it is spoken (note how the
        <code>span</code> inherits the voice-family from its parent paragraph).</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
{
  voice-family: paul;
  voice-stress: moderate;
  cue-before: url(../audio/ping.wav);
}
p.heidi
{
  voice-family: female;
  voice-balance: left;
  voice-pitch: high;
}
p.peter
{
  voice-family: male;
  voice-balance: right;
  voice-rate: fast;
}
span.special
{
  voice-volume: soft;
  pause-after: strong;
}

...

&lt;h1&gt;I am Paul, and I speak headings.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="heidi"&gt;Hello, I am Heidi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="peter"&gt;
  &lt;span class="special"&gt;Can you hear me ?&lt;/span&gt;
  I am Peter.
&lt;/p&gt;
            </pre>
    </div>
    <!-- p class="note">
      Note that the "aural" media type is deprecated, as defined in the informative CSS2.1 Aural appendix [[!CSS21]]).
      </p -->
    <h2 id="aural-model">The <dfn id="aural-box-model">aural "box" model</dfn></h2>
    <p>The CSS formatting model for aural media is based on a sequence of sounds and silences that
      occur within a nested context similar to the <a href="#box-model-def">visual box model</a>,
      which we name the aural "box" model. The aural canvas is one-dimensional, or "monolinear". The
      element is surrounded by 'rest', 'cue' and 'pause' properties (from the innermost to the
      outermost position). These can be seen as aural equivalents to 'padding', 'border' and
      'margin', respectively. The following diagram illustrates the equivalence between properties
      of the visual and aural box models, applied to the selected &lt;element&gt;:</p>

    <p>The 'voice-volume' property manipulates the amplitude of the audio waveform generated by the
      speech synthesiser, and is also used to calculate the relative volume level of <a
        href="#cue-props">audio cues</a> within the <a href="#aural-model">audio "box" model</a>. </p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the functionality provided by this property is related to the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#edef_prosody"><code>volume</code> attribute of
        the <code>prosody</code> element</a> from the SSML markup language [[!SPEECH-SYNTHESIS]]. </p>

      <dd>An integer or floating point <a href="#non-negative-number-def">positive number</a> in the
        range '0' to '100'. '0' represents the <em>minimum audible</em> level, and '100' corresponds
        to the <em>maximum tolerable</em> level. '50' corresponds to the user's preferred volume
        level. The numerical values exposed here are mapped to concrete volume levels that depend on
        the listening context. This allows authors to write a single style sheet that'll work in a
        variety of situations. <p class="note">Note that actual volume levels depend on various
          factors, such as the listening environment and personal user preferences. The effective
          volume variation between '0' and '100' determines the dynamic range of the speech output,
          which is typically compressed in a noisy environment (the volume corresponding to '0' is
          nearer the value of '100'), whereas a noise-free context allows for the full range of
          volume levels (the gap between '0' and '100' is wider). Conversely, there may be
          situations whereby both '0' and '100' are set to low volume levels (for example when
          listening discretely at night). </p>

        <strong>&lt;percentage&gt;</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> Only positive <a href="#percentage-def">percentage</a> values are allowed. Computed
        values are calculated relative to the inherited value, and are then clipped to the range '0'
        to '100'. <p class="note"> Note that a leading "+" sign does not denote an increment. For
          example, +50% is equivalent to 50%, so the computed value equals the inherited value times
          0.5 (divided by 2), then clipped to [0,100]. </p>

      <dd>The value of 'x-soft' is mapped to '0' (<em>minimum audible</em>) and 'x-loud' is mapped
        to '100' (<em>maximum tolerable</em>). The value 'medium' corresponds to '50'
          (<em>preferred</em> volume level) and is the default. The intermediary values 'soft' and
        'loud' are mapped to '25' and '75', respectively. Because the numerical volume scale may or
        may not be linear amplitude, this sequence of "named" values increases from 'x-soft' to
        'x-loud', but does not necessarily map to monotonically non-decreasing volume levels. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note"> Note that there is a difference between an element whose 'voice-volume'
      property has a value of 'silent', and an element whose 'speak' property has the value 'none'.
      The former takes up the same time as if it had been spoken, including any pause before and
      after the element, but no sound is generated (although descendants can override the
      'voice-volume' value and may therefore generate audio output). The latter requires no time and
      is not rendered in the aural dimension

      'voice-volume' does not apply to <a href

      <span class="issue" id="issue-voice-cues-volume">
      ISSUE: shouldn't audio cues be subjected to the voice-volume,
      so that an inaudible element gets its entire content (within the aural "box" model) muted as well ?
      The rationale is that voice-volume:silent is largely equivalent to visibility:hidden,
      which affects border, padding and spacing (i.e. the entire content with regards to the CSS "visual" box model).
      The audio cues should therefore only be allowed to set their volume levels <em>relatively</em> to the inherited voice-volume, not with absolute values as these may incorrectly enable audio output when the voice-volume itself is muted.

    <p> The pause defines the minimum distance of the aural "box" to the aural "boxes" before and
      after it. Adjoining pauses are merged by selecting the strongest named break and the longest
      absolute time interval. </p>
    <p class="note"> For example, "strong" is selected when comparing "strong" and "weak", "1s" is
      selected when comparing "1s" and "250ms", and "strong" and "250ms" take effect additively when
      comparing "strong" and "250ms". </p>
    <p>The following pauses are adjoining:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-after' of its last child, provided the
        former has no 'rest-after' and no 'cue-after'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its first child, provided
        the former has no 'rest-before' and no 'cue-before'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its next sibling.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' and 'pause-after' of an aural "box", if the the "box" has a
        'voice-duration' of "0ms" and no 'rest-before' or 'rest-after' and no 'cue-before' or
        'cue-after', or if the the "box" has no rendered content at all (see 'speak').</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A collapsed pause is considered adjoining to another pause if any of its component pauses is
      adjoining to that pause.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that 'pause' has been moved from between the element's contents and any
      'cue' to outside the 'cue'. This is not backwards compatible with the informative CSS2.1 Aural
      appendix [[!CSS21]].</p>

      until overridden by a further xml:lang attribute.</p>
    <p>If there is no voice available for the requested value of xml:lang, the processor should
      select a voice that is closest to the requested language (e.g. a variant or dialect of the
      same language). If there are multiple such voices available, the processor should use a voice
      that best matches the values provided with the 'voice-volume' property. It is an error if

      Unfortunately this introduces a dependency on a feature specific to CSS3-Lists. There is a <a

    </h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is non-normative.</p>
    <p> CSS does not specify how to define the pronunciation (expressed using a well-defined
      phonetic alphabet) of a particular piece of text within the markup document. A "phonemes"
      property was described in earlier drafts of this specification, but objections were raised due
      to breaking the principle of separation between content and presentation (the "phonemes"
      authored within aural CSS stylesheets would have needed to be updated each time text changed
      within the markup document). The "phonemes" functionality is therefore considered out-of-scope
      in CSS (the presentation layer) and should be addressed in the markup / content layer.</p>
    <p> The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon">PLS (Pronunciation Lexicon
        Specification)</a> recommendation is one potential format to use with the <a
        href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-pronunciation"></a>"pronunciation" <code>rel</code>
      value, which allows importing pronunciation lexicons in HTML documents using the
        <code>link</code> element (similarly to how CSS stylesheets can be included). </p>
    <p> Additionally, an attribute-based mechanism can be used within the markup to author
      text-pronunciation associations. At the time of writing, such mechanism isn't formally defined
      in the W3C HTML standard(s). However, the <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30">EPUB 3.0 draft
        specification</a> allows (x)HTML5 documents to contain SSML-derived attributes (<a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis">Speech Synthesis Markup Language</a>) that
      describe how to pronounce text based on a particular phonetic alphabet.</p>
    <!-- p> 
    One avenue to explore is the use CSS to "bind" HTML text with a   
    phoneme (also declared in the HTML document). This would maintain a   
    clear separation between content and presentation, and it would allow   
    authors to define different pronunciations for one given text token   
    (Media Queries could drive the switch of stylesheet to import). This   
    possibility has been mentioned several times by Working Group members   
    as well as people from the public mailing-list, so it cannot be   
    ignored. However, there are architectural considerations (e.g.   
    collision between CSS versus HTML -defined phonemes) which make this a   
    lot trickier to standardize than it sounds. The   
    whole "speech synthesis" issue should be tackled globally at the level   
    of the W3C ecosystem. For example, there are many cross-cutting   
    concerns with the work done by the HTML-Audio and HTML-Speech   
    Incubator Groups.

    <p> A phonetic alphabet is a collection of symbols that represent the sounds of one or more
      human languages. The default alphabet for the pronunciation string of the 'phonemes' property
      is the International Phonetic Alphabet ("ipa"), corresponding to Unicode representations of
      the phonetic characters developed by the International Phonetic Association [<a href="#IPA"
        >IPA</a>]. The phonetic alphabet can be explicitly specified using the <a
        href="#phonetic-alphabet">'@phonetic-alphabet'</a> rule.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the alphabet is specified via an at-rule to avoid problems with
      inappropriate cascades that can occur if the alphabet was set via a
      property.</p>
      -->
    <!-- [[CSS3CASCADE]] -->
    <!--
    <div class="example">
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>

      <p>This will direct the speech synthesizer to replace the default pronunciation by the

    </div>

    <p>At most one <a href="#phonetic-alphabet">'@phonetic-alphabet'</a> rule can appear in style
      sheet and it must appear, when used, before any occurrence of the 'phonemes' property. The

      "x-organization" or "x-organization-alphabet". </p>

            SSML 1.0 defines "ipa" to be the only valid

            want to follow this? Or do we allow some other values? SAMPA comes
            to my mind as a widely used ASCII alternative to IPA, but then: SAMPA
            is language-dependent, and it might be better to have X-SAMPA.</p -->

    <!-- div class="issue">
            <p>ISSUE: should there be a CSS equivalent to the SSML &lt;sub&gt;
            element? This gives the author the means to replace one string with
            another as means to changing how something is spoken, e.g. "as-key"
            for "ASCII". A possible solution is a new CSS property  'say-instead'
            for instance:</p>
            
            <pre>
            say-instead: "as-key";
            </pre>
            
            <p>The drawback with this property is that it has to be applied to a
            specific instance of an element and can't be used more generally.
            In the longer term, the use of pronunciation lexicons would provide a
            better solution.</p>
            </div -->
    <p>Sometimes, authors will want to specify a mapping from the source text into another string
      prior to the application of the regular pronunciation rules. This may be used for uncommon
      abbreviations or acronyms which are unlikely to be recognized by the synthesizer. The
      'content' property can be used to replace one string by another. In the following example, the
      abbreviation is rendered using the content of the title attribute instead of the element's
      content:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>
/* This replaces the content of the selected element
by the string "World Wide Web Consortium". */
abbr { content: attr(title); }
...

&lt;abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium"&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt;
            </pre>
    </div>
    <p>In a similar way, text strings in a document can be replaced by a previously recorded
      version. In the following example - assuming the format is supported, the file is available
      and the UA is configured to do so - a recording of Sir John Gielgud's declamation of the
      famous monologue is played. Otherwise the UA falls back to render the text using synthesized
      speech: </p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>
.hamlet { content: url(./audio/gielgud.wav); }
...

&lt;div class="hamlet"&gt;
To be, or not to be: that is the question:
&lt;/div&gt;
            </pre>
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, authors (or users via a user stylesheet) may add some information to ease the
      understanding of structures during non-visual interaction with the document. They can do so by
      using the '::before' and '::after' pseudo-elements that will be inserted between the element's
      contents and the 'rest' Note that different stylesheets can be used to define the level of
      verbosity for additional information spoken by screen readers. .</p>
    <p>The following example inserts the string "Start list: " before a list and the string "List
      item: " before the content of each list item. Likewise, the string "List end: " gets inserted
      after the list to inform the user that the list speech output is over.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre>
ul::before { content: "Start list: "; }
ul::after  { content: "List end. "; }
li::before { content: "List item: "; }
</pre>
    </div>

            <p>This provides a hint to the speech platform as to how to
            interpret the corresponding element's content and is useful when
            the content is ambigous and liable to be misinterpreted. Values

            <p>Specifies a date using the same syntax as SSML. For instance,

            <p>Specifies a time using the same syntax as SSML. For instance,
            "time(hm)" when applied to "06:30" would be interpreted as 6 hours
            and 30 minutes.</p>

            <p class="issue">The above definitions were taken from the SSML
            specification dated 23 August 2002, but there is continuing
            uncertainty as to how the SSML "say-as" mechanism will end up. If
            SSML doesn't provide the same set of input types, then it may be
            necessary to transform the content before it can be directly mapped
            into SSML. We may just choose to drop 'interpret-as' until a future
            revision of this specification when the details of the say-as
            element have been clarified.</p>

    <h3 class="no-num" id="conformance">Conformance</h3>
    <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions and RFC
      2119 terminology. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. However, for readability, these words
      do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. All of the text of this
      specification is normative except sections explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and
      notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
    <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words "for example" or are set apart
      from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>, like this: </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Informative notes begin with the word "Note" and are set apart from the normative text with
        <code>class="note"</code>, like this:</p>
    <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>
    <p>Conformance to the CSS3 Speech Module is defined for three classes:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      </dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS style sheet</a>.</dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn>renderer</dfn>
      </dt>
      <dd>A UA that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders <span>documents</span>
        that use them.</dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn>
      </dt>
      <dd>A UA that writes a style sheet.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A style sheet is conformant to the CSS3 Speech Module if all of its declarations that use
      properties defined in this module have values that are valid according to the generic CSS
      grammar and the individual grammars of each property as given in this module. </p>
    <p>A renderer is conformant to the CSS3 Speech Module if, in addition to interpreting the style
      sheet as defined by the appropriate specifications, it supports all the properties defined by
      CSS3 Speech Module by parsing them correctly and rendering the document accordingly. However
      the inability of a UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device does not
      make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not required to render color on a monochrome
      monitor.) </p>
    <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS3 Speech Module if it writes syntactically correct
      style sheets, according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
      property in this module. </p>
    <!-- h3 class="no-num" id="levels">Levels</h3>
            
            <p><em>This section is informative.</em> CSS has different levels of

            explanation.) The lists below describe which features from this

    <h3 class="no-num" id="exit">CR exit criteria</h3>
    <p>As described in the W3C process document, a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">Candidate Recommendation</a>
      (CR) is a specification that W3C recommends for use on the Web. The next stage is
      "Recommendation" when the specification is sufficiently implemented.</p>
    <p>For this specification to be proposed as a W3C Recommendation, the following conditions shall
      be met. There must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature.
      Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products, there is no requirement that
      all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define
      the following terms: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>independent</dt>
      <dd>each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse, or
        derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that have no
        bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from this requirement.</dd>
      <dt>interoperable</dt>
      <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the official CSS test suite, or, if the
        implementation is not a Web browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
        suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user agent (UA) is to be used to
        claim interoperability. In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
        then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those equivalent tests in the
        same way for the purpose of interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
        available for the purposes of peer review.</dd>
      <dt>implementation</dt>
      <dd>a user agent which: <ol class="inline">
          <li>implements the specification.</li>
          <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may be a shipping product or
            other publicly available version (i.e., beta version, preview release, or "nightly
            build"). Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the feature(s) for a period
            of at least one month in order to demonstrate stability.</li>
          <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed to pass the test suite and
            is not intended for normal usage going forward).</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A minimum of sixth months of the CR period must have elapsed. This is to ensure that enough
      time is given for any remaining major errors to be caught. </p>
    <p>Features will be dropped if two or more interoperable implementations are not found by the
      end of the CR period. </p>
    <p>Features may/will also be dropped if adequate/sufficient (by judgment of CSS WG) tests have
      not been produced for those feature(s) by the end of the CR period. </p>

        own list of changes</a>, which - for succinctness - is not repeated here. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed the "phonemes" property (and its associated "@alphabet" at-rule).</li>
      <li>Renamed 'speakability' to 'speak', and 'speak' to 'speak-as'.</li>
      <li>Added support for lists (item styles, numbering, etc.).</li>
      <li>Adjusted the [initial] value for shorthand properties, to be consistent with other CSS
        specifications (i.e. "see individual properties"), and removed the erroneous "inherit"
        value.</li>
      <li>Fixed numerical volume scale (and the associated "named" values). Also added the [silent]
        value to audio cues.</li>
      <li>Fixed the [initial] values for 'pause' and 'rest', which should be zero (were
        "implementation-dependent").</li>
      <li>Corrected the [initial] values for 'voice-pitch-range' and 'voice-pitch' to "medium".</li>
      <li>Added an "auto" value to 'voice-duration', which is the [initial] property value as
        well.</li>
      <li>Renamed voice-family fields to be consistent with SSML.</li>
      <li>Added a new section to define the relationship of this specification with CSS2.1.</li>
      <li>Added the missing "Computed value" line to each property definition.</li>
      <li>Cleaned-up the list of module dependencies, and removed redundant "module dependencies"
        section.</li>
      <li>Improved the pause collapsing prose, removed redundant paragraphs.</li>
      <li>Added the "normal" value for 'voice-stress'.</li>
      <li>Improved document structure by adding sub-sections.</li>
      <li>Fixed typos and made other minor edits.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- For reference only, changes in previous draft: -->
    <!-- ul>
            <li>Removed the "mark" property, see the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Feb/0029.html">Working Group resolution</a></li>
            <li>Added the 'speakability' property and removed the 'none' value of the 'speak' property,
            as per this <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jan/0483.html">discussion</a></li>
            <li>Fixed 'voice-family' grammar as per <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Dec/0231.html">this discussion</a></li>
            <li>The volume level of audio cues can only be set relatively to the inherited 'voice-volume' property (to avoid cues being spoken when the main element is silent, which contradicts the "aural box model").</li>
            <li>Added "HTML" to "CSS defines aural properties that give control over rendering
            XML to speech" in the abstract.</li>
            <li>Removed unused normative links to CSS3 Modules (actually moved to informative references), now the only dependency is CSS3 Values and Units.</li>
            <li>Removed issue about the 'sub' SSML element given that the CSS "content" replacement functionality addresses the same requirement.</li>
            <li>Added support for semitones in pitch alterations.</li>
            <li>Added reference to "time" values syntax (s, ms) for 'voice-duration'.</li>
            <li>Moved "content" outside of "phonetics", as the ::before and ::after use-cases do not relate to pronunciation rules (this is actually more similar to audio cues, only applied with text rather than audio files)</li>
            <li>Added prose to explicitly support alphabet other than IPA, via the "x-" vendor-specific prefix.</li>
            <li>Reworked HTML source code to work with the <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/member-bin/process.cgi">members-only W3C pre-processor/generator</a></li>
            <li>Added note about the "speech" and "aural" media types.</li>
            <li>Harmonized all hyperlinks so that CSS properties get auto-linked by the pre-processor</li>
            <li>Clarified computation rules for positive percentages with "+" prefixes (i.e. they do not denote increments, the regular multiplicative behavior is used).</li>
            <li>Fixed IPA URL reference</li>
            <li>Reorganized appendixes</li>
            <li>Fixed minor typos</li>
