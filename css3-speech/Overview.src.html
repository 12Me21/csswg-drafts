    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing the rendering of HTML and XML
      documents on various supports, such as on screen, on paper, in speech, etc. This specification
      defines aural CSS properties that allow control over the rendering of such documents via
      speech synthesis, and which are designed to match the model described in the Speech Synthesis
      Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0 [[!SPEECH-SYNTHESIS]]. </p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is non-normative.</p>
    <p>The speech rendering of a document, already commonly used by the blind and print-impaired
      communities, combines speech synthesis and "auditory icons". Often such aural presentation
      occurs by converting the document to plain text and feeding this to a screen reader &mdash;
      software or hardware that simply reads all the characters on the screen. This results in less
      effective presentation than would be the case if the document structure were retained. Style
      sheet properties for text to speech can be used together with visual properties (mixed media)
      or as an aural alternative to visual presentation.</p>
    <p>Besides the obvious accessibility advantages, there are other large markets for listening to
      information, including in-car use, industrial and medical documentation systems (intranets),
      home entertainment, and to help users learning to read or who have difficulty reading.</p>
    <p>When using voice properties, the aural canvas consists of a two channel stereo space and a
      temporal space. For example, you can specify <a href="#cue-props">audio cues</a> before and
      after synthetic speech). The CSS properties also allow authors to vary the characteristics of
      synthetic speech (voice type, frequency, inflection, etc.).</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <pre>
                h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
                voice-family: paul;
                voice-stress: moderate;
                cue-before: url(ping.au)
                }
                p.heidi { voice-balance: left; voice-family: female }
                p.peter { voice-balance: right; voice-family: male }
                p.goat  { voice-volume: soft }
            </pre>
    </div>
    <p>This will direct the speech synthesizer to speak headers in a voice (a kind of "audio font")
      called "paul". Before speaking the headers, a sound sample will be played from the given URL.
      Paragraphs with class "heidi" will appear to come from the left (if the sound system is
      capable of stereo), and paragraphs of class "peter" from the right. Paragraphs with class
      "goat" will be played softly.</p>
    <!-- p class="note">
            Note that the "aural" media type is deprecated, as defined in the informative CSS2.1 Aural appendix [[!CSS21]]).
            </p -->
    <h2 id="css21-rel">Relationship with CSS2.1</h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is non-normative.</p>
    <p> This specification is a re-work of the informative CSS2.1 Aural appendix [[!CSS21]], within
      which the "aural" media type was described and deprecated at the same time. Although the
      [[!CSS21]] specification reserves the "speech" media type, it doesn't actually define the
      properties that apply to this context. The CSS3 Speech module specifies the set of properties
      for the "speech" media type, and defines a new "box" model for the aural dimension. </p>
    <p> Note that content creators can conditionally include CSS properties authored specifically
      for user-agents with text to speech capabilities (TTS), by specifying the "speech" media type
      via the <code>media</code> attribute of the <code>link</code> element, or with the
        <code>@media</code> at-rule, or within an <code>@import</code> statement. When doing so, the
      styles authored within the scope of such conditional statements are ignored by user-agents
      that do not support speech synthesis. </p>
    <h2 id="aural-model">The <dfn id="aural-box-model">aural "box" model</dfn></h2>
    <p>The formatting model of CSS for aural media is based on a sequence of sounds and silences
      that appear in a nested model which is related to the <a href="#box-model-def">visual box
        model</a>; however the aural canvas is one-dimensional, monolinear. For compatibility with
      the visual box model, we will call it the aural "box" model. <!-- [[CSS3BOX]] -->
    </p>
    <p>The element is surrounded by, in this order, 'rest', 'cue' and 'pause' properties - they can
      be thought of as aural equivalents to 'padding', 'border' and 'margin' respectively.</p>
    <p>It can be represented in the following way (including the equivalent properties from the
      visual box model for clarification of relationships):</p>
    <p>
      <img alt="A graph depicting the aural 'box' model." id="aural-box" src="aural-box.png" />

      Module apply.</p>

    <p>The 'voice-volume' refers to the amplitude of the waveform output by the speech synthesiser.
      This may be mixed with other audio sources, influencing the perceived loudness of synthetic
      speech relative to these sources. </p>
    <!-- p>
            'voice-volume' does not apply to <a href
            ="#cue-props">audio cues</a> for which there is a separate means
            to set loudness (absolute, or relative to 'voice-volume').
            <span class="issue" id="issue-voice-cues-volume">
            ISSUE: shouldn't audio cues be subjected to the voice-volume,
            so that an inaudible element gets its entire content (within the aural "box" model) muted as well ?
            The rationale is that voice-volume:silent is largely equivalent to visibility:hidden,
            which affects border, padding and spacing (i.e. the entire content with regards to the CSS "visual" box model).
            The audio cues should therefore only be allowed to set their volume levels <em>relatively</em> to the inherited voice-volume, not with absolute values as these may incorrectly enable audio output when the voice-volume itself is muted.

                otherwise resolves to a computed value of 'silent'.

      <dt>
        <strong>&lt;non-negative number&gt;</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>An integer or floating point <a href="#non-negative-number-def">positive number</a> in the
        range '0' to '100'. '0' represents silence (the <em>minimum</em> level), and '100'
        corresponds to the <em>maximum</em> level. The volume scale is linear amplitude. </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>&lt;percentage&gt;</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> Only positive <a href="#percentage-def">percentage</a> values are allowed. Computed
        values are calculated relative to the inherited value, and are then clipped to the range '0'
        to '100'. <p class="note"> Note that a leading "+" sign does not denote an increment. For
          example, +50% is equivalent to 50%, so the computed value equals the inherited value times
          0.5 (divided by 2), then clipped to [0,100]. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><strong>silent</strong>, <strong>x-soft</strong>, <strong>soft</strong>,
          <strong>medium</strong>, <strong>loud</strong>, and <strong>x-loud</strong></dt>
      <dd>A sequence of monotonically non-decreasing volume levels. The value of 'silent' is mapped
        to '0' and 'x-loud' is mapped to '100'. The mapping of other values to numerical volume
        levels is implementation-dependent and may vary from one speech synthesizer to another.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>User agents should allow the level corresponding to '100' to be set by the listener. No one
      setting is universally applicable; suitable values depend on the equipment in use (speakers,
      headphones), and the environment (in car, home theater, library) and personal preferences.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that there is a difference between an element whose 'voice-volume'
      property has a value of 'silent', and an element whose 'speak' property has the value 'none'.
      The former takes up the same time as if it had been spoken, including any pause before and
      after the element, but no sound is generated (although descendants can override the
      'voice-volume' value and may therefore generate audio output). The latter requires no time and
      is not rendered in the aural dimension
      <!-- (including its descendants, which cannot override the inherited 'none' value). -->

    <p>This property specifies whether text will be rendered aurally.</p>
    <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <strong>auto</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> Resolves to a computed value of 'none' when 'display' is 'none', otherwise resolves to a
        computed value of 'auto' which yields a used value of 'normal'. <p class="note"> Note that
          'display' is the only property defined externally to this CSS3 module that affects
          behavior within the aural "box" model. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>none</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> This value causes an element (including pauses, cues, rests and actual content) to not be
        rendered (i.e., the element has no effect in the aural dimension). <p class="note"> Note
          that any of the descendants of the affected element are allowed to override this value, so
          they may actually take part in the aural rendering. However, the pauses, cues, and rests
          of the ancestor element remain "deactivated" in the aural dimension, and therefore do not
          contribute to the <a href="#collapsing">collapsing of pauses</a> or additive behavior of
          adjoining rests. </p>
        <!--
                    Descendant elements do not get rendered either;
                    this behavior cannot be overridden by setting the 'speak' property on the descendants.
                -->
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>normal</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> The element is rendered aurally. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="note"> Note that although the 'none' value of the 'display' property cannot be
      overridden by descendants of the affected element, the 'auto' value of 'speak' can however be
      overridden by descendants, using either of 'none' or 'normal'. In the case of 'normal', this
      would result in descendants being rendered in the aural dimension even though they would not
      be rendered on the visual canvas.
      <!-- To ensure that an element <em>and its descendants</em> do not get rendered in the aural dimension,
                use the 'none' value for the 'speak' property. -->

    <p>This property specifies in what manner text gets rendered aurally.</p>
    <p>Values have the following meanings:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <strong>normal</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>Uses language-dependent pronunciation rules for rendering an element and its children.
        Punctuation is not to be spoken, but instead rendered naturally as various pauses.</dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>spell-out</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>Spells the text one letter at a time (useful for acronyms and abbreviations). In languages
        where accented characters are rare, it is permitted to drop accents in favor of alternative
        unaccented spellings. As as example, in English, the word "r&ocirc;le" can also be written
        as "role". A conforming implementation would thus be able to spell-out "r&ocirc;le" as "R O
        L E".</dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>digits</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>Speak numbers one digit at a time, for instance, "twelve" would be spoken as "one two",
        and "31" as "three one".</dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>literal-punctuation</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>Similar to 'normal' value, but punctuation such as semicolons, braces, and so on are to be
        spoken literally.</dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>no-punctuation</strong>

    <p>Speech synthesizers are knowledgeable about what is and what is not a number. The 'speak-as'
      property gives authors the means to control how the synthesizer renders the numbers it
      discovers in the source text, and may be implemented as a preprocessing step before passing
      the text to the speech synthesizer.</p>

    <p>The 'pause' property is a shorthand for setting 'pause-before' and 'pause-after'. If two
      values are given, the first value is 'pause-before' and the second is 'pause-after'. If only
      one value is given, it applies to both properties.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <pre>
                h1 { pause: 20ms } /* pause-before: 20ms; pause-after: 20ms */
                h2 { pause: 30ms 40ms } /* pause-before: 30ms; pause-after: 40ms */
                h3 { pause-after: 10ms } /* pause-before: <i>unspecified</i>; pause-after: 10ms */
            </pre>
    </div>
    <p> The default strengths of prosodic breaks for specific elements are defined by the user-agent
      stylesheet, and can be overridden by authored styles, as demonstrated by the example below. </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
                p { pause: none } /* pause-before: none; pause-after: none */
            </pre>
    </div>
    <p class="note"> Note that stronger content boundaries are typically accompanied by pauses. For
      example, the breaks between paragraphs are typically much more substantial than the breaks
      between words within a sentence. </p>
    <h3 id="collapsing">Collapsing pauses</h3>
    <p> The pause defines the minimum distance of the aural "box" to the aural "boxes" before and
      after it. Adjoining pauses are merged by selecting the strongest named break and the longest
      absolute time interval. </p>
    <p class="note"> For example, "strong" is selected when comparing "strong" and "weak", "1s" is
      selected when comparing "1s" and "250ms", and "strong" and "250ms" take effect additively when
      comparing "strong" and "250ms". </p>
    <p>The following pauses are adjoining:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-after' of its last child, provided the
        former has no 'rest-after' and no 'cue-after'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its first child, provided
        the former has no 'rest-before' and no 'cue-before'.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-after' of an aural "box" and the 'pause-before' of its next sibling.</li>
      <li>The 'pause-before' and 'pause-after' of an aural "box", if the the "box" has a
        'voice-duration' of "0ms" and no 'rest-before' or 'rest-after' and no 'cue-before' or
        'cue-after', or if the the "box" has no rendered content at all (see 'speak').</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A collapsed pause is considered adjoining to another pause if any of its component pauses is
      adjoining to that pause.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that 'pause' has been moved from between the element's contents and any
      'cue' to outside the 'cue'. This is not backwards compatible with the informative CSS2.1 Aural
      appendix [[!CSS21]].</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <strong>&lt;time&gt;</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>Expresses the rest in absolute time units (seconds and milliseconds, e.g. "+3s", "250ms")
        as per the syntax of <a href="#time-def">time</a> values defined in [[!CSS3VAL]]. Only
        positive values are allowed.</dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>none</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> Equivalent to 0ms (no prosodic break in the speech output). This value can be used to
        inhibit a prosodic break which the processor would otherwise produce. </dd>
      <dt>
        <strong>x-weak</strong>, <strong>weak</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>,
          <strong>strong</strong>, and <strong>x-strong</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd> Expresses the rest by the strength of the prosodic break in speech output. The exact time
        is implementation-dependent. The values indicate monotonically non-decreasing (conceptually
        increasing) break strength between elements. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>As opposed to <a href="#pause-props">pause properties</a>, the rest is inserted between the
      element's content and any 'cue-before' or 'cue-after' content. Adjoining rests are treated
      additively, and do not collapse.</p>

        values are calculated relative to the inherited value of the 'voice-volume' property, and
        are then clipped to the range '0' to '100'. '0' represents silence (the <em>minimum</em>
        level), and 100 corresponds to the <em>maximum</em> level. The volume scale is linear
        amplitude. By basing the percentage upon the inherited value for 'voice-volume', it is easy

    <p>If there is no voice available for the requested value of xml:lang, the processor should
      select a voice that is closest to the requested language (e.g. a variant or dialect of the
      same language). If there are multiple such voices available, the processor should use a voice
      that best matches the values provided with the 'voice-volume' property. It is an error if
      there are no such matches.</p>

      One suggestion is to ignore list-style-type (which can represent visual glyphs not suitable

        href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-lists/#marker-pseudoelement">list "markers"</a>.
      Unfortunately this introduces a dependency on a feature specific to CSS3-Lists. There is a <a

    </h2>
    <p class="note">Note that this entire section is non-normative.</p>
    <p> CSS does not specify how to define the pronunciation (expressed using a well-defined
      phonetic alphabet) of a particular piece of text within the markup document. A "phonemes"
      property was described in earlier drafts of this specification, but objections were raised due
      to breaking the principle of separation between content and presentation (the "phonemes"
      authored within aural CSS stylesheets would have needed to be updated each time text changed
      within the markup document). The "phonemes" functionality is therefore considered out-of-scope
      in CSS (the presentation layer) and should be addressed in the markup / content layer.</p>
    <p> The W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon">PLS (Pronunciation Lexicon
        Specification)</a> recommendation is one potential format to use with the <a
        href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-pronunciation"></a>"pronunciation"
        <strong>rel</strong> value, which allows importing pronunciation lexicons in HTML documents
      using the <strong>link</strong> element (similarly to how CSS stylesheets can be included). </p>
    <p> Additionally, an attribute-based mechanism can be used within the markup to author
      text-pronunciation associations. At the time of writing, such mechanism isn't formally defined
      in the W3C HTML standard(s). However, the <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30">EPUB 3.0 draft
        specification</a> allows (x)HTML5 documents to contain SSML-derived attributes (<a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis">Speech Synthesis Markup Language</a>) that
      describe how to pronounce text based on a particular phonetic alphabet.</p>
    <!-- p> 
    One avenue to explore is the use CSS to "bind" HTML text with a   
    phoneme (also declared in the HTML document). This would maintain a   
    clear separation between content and presentation, and it would allow   
    authors to define different pronunciations for one given text token   
    (Media Queries could drive the switch of stylesheet to import). This   
    possibility has been mentioned several times by Working Group members   
    as well as people from the public mailing-list, so it cannot be   
    ignored. However, there are architectural considerations (e.g.   
    collision between CSS versus HTML -defined phonemes) which make this a   
    lot trickier to standardize than it sounds. The   
    whole "speech synthesis" issue should be tackled globally at the level   
    of the W3C ecosystem. For example, there are many cross-cutting   
    concerns with the work done by the HTML-Audio and HTML-Speech   
    Incubator Groups.

      the content of the aural 'phonemes' property). The broader aspect of pronunciation lexicons

    <p> A phonetic alphabet is a collection of symbols that represent the sounds of one or more
      human languages. The default alphabet for the pronunciation string of the 'phonemes' property
      is the International Phonetic Alphabet ("ipa"), corresponding to Unicode representations of
      the phonetic characters developed by the International Phonetic Association [<a href="#IPA"
        >IPA</a>]. The phonetic alphabet can be explicitly specified using the <a
        href="#phonetic-alphabet">'@phonetic-alphabet'</a> rule.</p>
    <p class="note"> Note that the alphabet is specified via an at-rule to avoid problems with
      inappropriate cascades that can occur if the alphabet was set via a
      property.</p>

    <!-- [[CSS3CASCADE]] -->
    <!--
    <div class="example">

    <p>At most one <a href="#phonetic-alphabet">'@phonetic-alphabet'</a> rule can appear in style
      sheet and it must appear, when used, before any occurrence of the 'phonemes' property. The

            SSML 1.0 defines "ipa" to be the only valid
            value - any other value should be added with the "x-" prefix. Do we
            want to follow this? Or do we allow some other values? SAMPA comes
            to my mind as a widely used ASCII alternative to IPA, but then: SAMPA

    <!-- div class="issue">
            <p>ISSUE: should there be a CSS equivalent to the SSML &lt;sub&gt;
            element? This gives the author the means to replace one string with
            another as means to changing how something is spoken, e.g. "as-key"
            for "ASCII". A possible solution is a new CSS property  'say-instead'
            for instance:</p>
            
            <pre>
            say-instead: "as-key";

            <p>The drawback with this property is that it has to be applied to a
            specific instance of an element and can't be used more generally.

            better solution.</p>
            </div -->
    <p>Sometimes, authors will want to specify a mapping from the source text into another string
      prior to the application of the regular pronunciation rules. This may be used for uncommon
      abbreviations or acronyms which are unlikely to be recognized by the synthesizer. The
      'content' property can be used to replace one string by another. In the following example, the
      abbreviation is rendered using the content of the title attribute instead of the element's
      content:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
                abbr { content: attr(title); }
                ...
                
                &lt;abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium"&gt;W3C&lt;/abbr&gt;
            </pre>
      <p>This replaces the content of the selected element by the string "World Wide Web
        Consortium".</p>
    </div>
    <p>In a similar way text-to-speech strings in a document can be replaced by a previously
      recorded version:</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
                .hamlet { content: url(gielgud.wav); }
                ...
                
                &lt;div class="hamlet"&gt;
                To be, or not to be: that is the question:
                &lt;/div&gt;
            </pre>
      <p>If the format is supported, the file is available and the UA is configured to do so, a
        recording of Sir John Gielgud's declamation of the famous monologue will be played,
        otherwise the UA falls back to render the text-to-speech with its own synthesizer.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Furthermore, authors (or via a user stylesheet) may add some information to ease
      understanding the structure for non-visual interaction with the document. They can do so by
      using the '::before' and '::after' pseudo-elements that will be inserted between the element's
      contents and the 'rest':</p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
                ul::before { content: "Start list: " }
                ul::after  { content: "List end. " }
                li::before { content: "List item: " }
            </pre>
      <p>This inserts the string "Start list: " before a list and the string "List item: " before
        each list item; likewise the string "List end: " inserted after the list will inform the
        user that the list is finished.</p>
      <p>Different stylesheets can be used to define the level of verbosity for additional
        information spoken by screen readers.</p>

            <p class="issue">The above definitions were taken from the SSML
            specification dated 23 August 2002, but there is continuing
            uncertainty as to how the SSML "say-as" mechanism will end up. If
            SSML doesn't provide the same set of input types, then it may be
            necessary to transform the content before it can be directly mapped
            into SSML. We may just choose to drop 'interpret-as' until a future
            revision of this specification when the details of the say-as
            element have been clarified.</p>

    <h3 class="no-num" id="conformance">Conformance</h3>
    <p>Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of descriptive assertions and RFC
      2119 terminology. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. However, for readability, these words
      do not appear in all uppercase letters in this specification. All of the text of this
      specification is normative except sections explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and
      notes. [[!RFC2119]]</p>
    <p>Examples in this specification are introduced with the words "for example" or are set apart
      from the normative text with <code>class="example"</code>, like this: </p>
    <div class="example">
      <p>This is an example of an informative example.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Informative notes begin with the word "Note" and are set apart from the normative text with
        <code>class="note"</code>, like this:</p>
    <p class="note">Note, this is an informative note.</p>
    <p>Conformance to the CSS3 Speech Module is defined for three classes:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn>
      </dt>
      <dd>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS style sheet</a>.</dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn>renderer</dfn>
      </dt>
      <dd>A UA that interprets the semantics of a style sheet and renders <span>documents</span>
        that use them.</dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn>
      </dt>
      <dd>A UA that writes a style sheet.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A style sheet is conformant to the CSS3 Speech Module if all of its declarations that use
      properties defined in this module have values that are valid according to the generic CSS
      grammar and the individual grammars of each property as given in this module. </p>
    <p>A renderer is conformant to the CSS3 Speech Module if, in addition to interpreting the style
      sheet as defined by the appropriate specifications, it supports all the properties defined by
      CSS3 Speech Module by parsing them correctly and rendering the document accordingly. However
      the inability of a UA to correctly render a document due to limitations of the device does not
      make the UA non-conformant. (For example, a UA is not required to render color on a monochrome
      monitor.) </p>
    <p>An authoring tool is conformant to CSS3 Speech Module if it writes syntactically correct
      style sheets, according to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each
      property in this module. </p>
    <!-- h3 class="no-num" id="levels">Levels</h3>
            
            <p><em>This section is informative.</em> CSS has different levels of
            features, each a subset of the other. (See [[CSSBEIJING]] for a full
            explanation.) The lists below describe which features from this

    <h3 class="no-num" id="exit">CR exit criteria</h3>
    <p>As described in the W3C process document, a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">Candidate Recommendation</a>
      (CR) is a specification that W3C recommends for use on the Web. The next stage is
      "Recommendation" when the specification is sufficiently implemented.</p>
    <p>For this specification to be proposed as a W3C Recommendation, the following conditions shall
      be met. There must be at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature.
      Each feature may be implemented by a different set of products, there is no requirement that
      all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion, we define
      the following terms: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>independent</dt>
      <dd>each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse, or
        derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code that have no
        bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from this requirement.</dd>
      <dt>interoperable</dt>
      <dd>passing the respective test case(s) in the official CSS test suite, or, if the
        implementation is not a Web browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test
        suite should have an equivalent test created if such a user agent (UA) is to be used to
        claim interoperability. In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
        then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those equivalent tests in the
        same way for the purpose of interoperability. The equivalent tests must be made publicly
        available for the purposes of peer review.</dd>
      <dt>implementation</dt>
      <dd>a user agent which: <ol class="inline">
          <li>implements the specification.</li>
          <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may be a shipping product or
            other publicly available version (i.e., beta version, preview release, or "nightly
            build"). Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the feature(s) for a period
            of at least one month in order to demonstrate stability.</li>
          <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed to pass the test suite and
            is not intended for normal usage going forward).</li>
        </ol>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>A minimum of sixth months of the CR period must have elapsed. This is to ensure that enough
      time is given for any remaining major errors to be caught. </p>
    <p>Features will be dropped if two or more interoperable implementations are not found by the
      end of the CR period. </p>
    <p>Features may/will also be dropped if adequate/sufficient (by judgment of CSS WG) tests have
      not been produced for those feature(s) by the end of the CR period. </p>

        own list of changes</a>, which - for succinctness - is not repeated here. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removed the "phonemes" property (and its associated "@alphabet" at-rule).</li>
      <li>Renamed 'speakability' to 'speak', and 'speak' to 'speak-as'.</li>
      <li>Added support for lists (item styles, numbering, etc.).</li>
      <li>Adjusted the [initial] value for shorthand properties, to be consistent with other CSS
        specifications (i.e. "see individual properties"), and removed the erroneous "inherit"
        value.</li>
      <li>Fixed the [initial] values for 'pause' and 'rest', which should be zero (were
        "implementation-dependent").</li>
      <li>Corrected the [initial] values for 'voice-pitch-range' and 'voice-pitch' to "medium".</li>
      <li>Added an "auto" value to 'voice-duration', which is the [initial] property value as
        well.</li>
      <li>Renamed voice-family fields to be consistent with SSML.</li>
      <li>Added a new section to define the relationship of this specification with CSS2.1.</li>
      <li>Added the missing "Computed value" line to each property definition.</li>
      <li>Cleaned-up the list of module dependencies, and removed redundant "module dependencies"
        section.</li>
      <li>Improved the pause collapsing prose, removed redundant paragraphs.</li>
      <li>Added the "auto" value for 'voice-stress'.</li>
      <li>Improved document structure by adding sub-sections.</li>
      <li>Fixed typos and made other minor edits.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- For reference only, changes in previous draft: -->
    <!-- ul>
            <li>Removed the "mark" property, see the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Feb/0029.html">Working Group resolution</a></li>
            <li>Added the 'speakability' property and removed the 'none' value of the 'speak' property,
            as per this <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jan/0483.html">discussion</a></li>
            <li>Fixed 'voice-family' grammar as per <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2010Dec/0231.html">this discussion</a></li>
            <li>The volume level of audio cues can only be set relatively to the inherited 'voice-volume' property (to avoid cues being spoken when the main element is silent, which contradicts the "aural box model").</li>
            <li>Added "HTML" to "CSS defines aural properties that give control over rendering
            XML to speech" in the abstract.</li>
            <li>Removed unused normative links to CSS3 Modules (actually moved to informative references), now the only dependency is CSS3 Values and Units.</li>
            <li>Removed issue about the 'sub' SSML element given that the CSS "content" replacement functionality addresses the same requirement.</li>
            <li>Added support for semitones in pitch alterations.</li>
            <li>Added reference to "time" values syntax (s, ms) for 'voice-duration'.</li>
            <li>Moved "content" outside of "phonetics", as the ::before and ::after use-cases do not relate to pronunciation rules (this is actually more similar to audio cues, only applied with text rather than audio files)</li>
            <li>Added prose to explicitly support alphabet other than IPA, via the "x-" vendor-specific prefix.</li>
            <li>Reworked HTML source code to work with the <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/member-bin/process.cgi">members-only W3C pre-processor/generator</a></li>
            <li>Added note about the "speech" and "aural" media types.</li>
            <li>Harmonized all hyperlinks so that CSS properties get auto-linked by the pre-processor</li>
            <li>Clarified computation rules for positive percentages with "+" prefixes (i.e. they do not denote increments, the regular multiplicative behavior is used).</li>
            <li>Fixed IPA URL reference</li>
            <li>Reorganized appendixes</li>
            <li>Fixed minor typos</li>
