Introduction</h2>

	<em>This section is not normative.</em>

	CSS Levels 1 and 2 allowed for the alignment of text via 'text-align' and
	the alignment of blocks by balancing ''margin/auto'' margins. However, except in
	table cells, vertical alignment was not possible. As CSS3 adds further
	capabilities, the ability to align boxes in various dimensions becomes more
	critical. This module attempts to create a cohesive and common box alignment
	model to share among all of CSS.

	Note: The alignment of text and inline-level content is defined in [[CSS3TEXT]] and [[CSS3LINE]].

Module interactions</h3>

	This module adds some new alignment capabilities to the block layout
	model described in [[!CSS21]] chapters 9 and 10 and defines the interaction
	of these properties with the alignment of table cell content using
	'vertical-align', as defined in [[!CSS21]] chapter 17.
	The interaction of these properties with
	Grid Layout [[!CSS3-GRID-LAYOUT]]
	and Flexible Box Layout [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]]
	is defined in their respective modules.

	No properties in this module apply to the <code>::first-line</code> or
	<code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

	This specification follows the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
	definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
	this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
	Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
	example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module, adds the
	''initial'' keyword as a possible property value.

	In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions,
	all properties defined in this specification also accept the
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">inherit</a>
	keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been repeated
	explicitly.


<h2 id="overview">
Overview of Alignment Properties</h2>

	The alignment properties in CSS can be described along two axes:

	<ul>
		<li>which dimension they apply to (inline vs. stacking), and
		<li>whether they control the position of the box within its parent, or the box's content within itself.
	</ul>

	Note: This proposal uses the terms “justify” and “align” to distinguish
	between alignment in the inline and stacking dimensions, respectively.
	The choice is somewhat arbitrary, but having the two terms allows for
	a consistent naming scheme that works across all of CSS's layout models.

	The following table summarizes the proposed alignment properties
	and the display types they can apply to.

	<table class=data>
	<colgroup span=1></colgroup>
	<colgroup span=2></colgroup>
	<colgroup span=1></colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Common

		<tr>
			<th>'align-items'

	</table>

	<p class=issue>
		The exact definition of these properties
		outside what's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox">what's defined in Flexbox</a>
		is still <strong>being worked out</strong>.
		This is a <strong>second Working Draft</strong>
		and is <strong>NOT STABLE</strong>.

	Note: The '*-items' values don't affect the element itself.
	When set on a flex container or grid container,
	they specify the interpretation of any ''align/justify-self: auto'' used on the items in the container element.

<h2 id='alignment-values'>
Alignment Values</h2>

	All of the alignment properties use a common set of values,
	defined below.

	<dl>
		<dt><dfn export>alignment subject</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a>alignment subject</a> is the thing or things being aligned by the property.
			For 'justify-self' and 'align-self',
			the <a>alignment subject</a> is the margin box of the box the property is set on.
			For 'justify-content' and 'align-content',
			the <a>alignment subject</a> is defined by the layout mode.

		<dt><dfn export>alignment container</dfn>
		<dd>
			The <a>alignment container</a> is the rectangle that the <a>alignment subject</a> is aligned within.
			This is defined by the layout mode,
			but is usually the <a>alignment subject</a>’s containing block.
	</dl>

<h3 id='positional-values'>
Positional Alignment: the ''center'', ''start'', ''end'', ''self-start'', ''self-end'', ''flex-start'', ''flex-end'', ''left'', ''right'', and ''<item-position>/stretch'' keywords</h3>

	The positional alignment keywords specify a position for an <a>alignment subject</a>
	with respect to its <a>alignment container</a>.

	The <<item-position>> set of values is used by 'justify-self' and 'align-self'
	to align the box within its <a>alignment container</a>,
	and also by 'justify-items' and 'align-items'
	(to specify default values for 'justify-self' and 'align-self').
	The <<content-position>> set of values is used by 'justify-content' and 'align-content'
	to align the box's contents within itself.

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>&lt;item-position></dfn> = center | start | end | self-start | self-end |
		                   flex-start | flex-end | left | right | stretch;
		<dfn>&lt;content-position></dfn> = center | start | end | flex-start | flex-end | left | right;
	</pre>


	Values have the following meanings:

	<dl dfn-type="value">
		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>, <content-position>">center</dfn>
		<dd>Centers the <a>alignment subject</a> within its <a>alignment container</a>.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>">stretch</dfn>
		<dd>If the 'width' or 'height' (as appropriate) of the <a>alignment subject</a> is ''width/auto'',
			its used value is the length necessary to make the <a>alignment subject</a>’s outer size
			as close to the size of the <a>alignment container</a> as possible,
			while still respecting the constraints imposed by 'min-height'/'max-width'/etc.
			Otherwise, this is equivalent to ''start''.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>, <content-position>">start</dfn>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the <a>alignment container</a>’s start edge.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>, <content-position>">end</dfn>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the <a>alignment container</a>’s end edge.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>">self-start</dfn>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>alignment subject</a>’s start side.
			If the <a>writing modes</a> of the <a>alignment subject</a> and the <a>alignment container</a> are <a>orthogonal</a>,
			this value computes to ''start''.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>">self-end</dfn>
		<dd>Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>alignment subject</a>’s end side.
			If the <a>writing modes</a> of the <a>alignment subject</a> and the <a>alignment container</a> are <a>orthogonal</a>,
			this value computes to ''end''.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>, <content-position>">flex-start</dfn>
		<dd><strong>Only used in flex layout.</strong> [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]]
			Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>flex container</a>’s main-start or cross-start side, as appropriate.
			When used in layout modes other than Flexbox,
			this value computes to ''start''.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>, <content-position>">flex-end</dfn>
		<dd><strong>Only used in flex layout.</strong>
			Aligns the <a>alignment subject</a> to be flush with the edge of the <a>alignment container</a>
			corresponding to the <a>flex container</a>’s main-end or cross-end side, as appropriate.
			When used in layout modes other than Flexbox,
			this value computes to ''end''.

		<dt><dfn for="<item-position>, <content-position>">left</dfn>

<h3 id='baseline'>
Baseline Alignment: the ''baseline'' and ''last-baseline'' keywords</h3>

	<dfn>Baseline alignment</dfn> is a form of positional alignment
	that aligns multiple <a>alignment subjects</a> within a <a>shared alignment context</a> (such as cells within a row or column)
	by matching up their <a>alignment baselines</a>.

	The baseline alignment keywords are:

	<pre class='prod'>
		<dfn>&lt;baseline-position></dfn> = baseline | last-baseline
	</pre>

	and are defined below:

	<dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="justify-content, justify-self, justify-items, align-content, align-self, align-items">
		<dt><dfn>baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates <dfn dfn>first-baseline alignment</dfn>:
			aligns one of the box's <a>first baselines</a>
			with the corresponding <a>first baselines</a>
			of all the boxes in its <a>baseline-sharing group</a>.

			If the <a>alignment subject</a>’s position is not fully determined by <a>baseline alignment</a>,
			the content is ''self-start''-aligned insofar as possible while preserving the baseline alignment.
			(Content that has no <a>first baselines</a> is thus start-aligned.)

		<dt><dfn>last-baseline</dfn>
		<dd>
			Indicates <dfn dfn>last-baseline alignment</dfn>:
			aligns one of the box's <a>last baselines</a>
			with the corresponding <a>last baselines</a>
			of all the boxes in its <a>baseline-sharing group</a>.

			If the <a>alignment subject</a>’s position is not fully determined by <a>baseline alignment</a>,
			the content is ''self-end''-aligned insofar as possible while preserving the baseline alignment.
			(Content that has no <a>last baselines</a> is thus end-aligned.)
	</dl>

	These values give a box a <dfn>baseline alignment preference</dfn>:
	either "first" or "last", respectively.

	When specified for 'align-content'/'justify-content',
	these values trigger <a>baseline content-alignment</a>,
	shifting the content of the box within the box,
	and may also affect the sizing of the box itself.
	See [#baseline-align-content].

	When specified for 'align-self'/'justify-self',
	these values trigger <a>baseline self-alignment</a>,
	shifting the entire box within its container,
	which may affect the sizing of its container.
	See [#baseline-align-self].

	If both <a>baseline content-alignment</a> <em>and</em> <a>baseline self-alignment</a> are specified in the same axis,
	only <a>baseline self-alignment</a> is honored in that axis;
	the content-alignment in that axis must be treated as ''self-start''.

	Issue: The previous paragraph is fairly arbitrary.
	Need some experience to make sure it's the correct choice out of the two possibilities.

	<p class='issue'>Add example images.

	Note: The 'vertical-align' property will also need a ''first-baseline'' value
	because per CSS2.1 for inline blocks, ''baseline'' is equivalent to ''last-baseline''.

	<hr>

	A <dfn>baseline-sharing group</dfn>
	is composed of boxes that participate in baseline alignment together.
	This is possible only if they

	<ul>
		<li>share an <a>alignment context</a> whose axis is parallel to their <a>inline axis</a>
		<li>either have the same <a>block flow direction</a> and <a>baseline alignment preference</a>,
			or have opposite <a>block flow direction</a> and opposite <a>baseline alignment preference</a>
			(in other words, the baselines that want to align are on the same side of the alignment context).
	</ul>

	Boxes <dfn title="shared alignment context|alignment context">share an alignment context</dfn> along a particular axis when they are:

	<ul>
		<li>table cells in the same row, along the table's row (inline) axis
		<li>table cells in the same column, along the table's column (block) axis
		<li>grid items in the same row, along the grid's row (inline) axis
		<li>grid items in the same column, along the grid's colum (block) axis
		<li>flex items in the same flex line, along the flex container's main axis
	</ul>

	Boxes in a <a>baseline-sharing group</a> are aligned to each other
	using their <dfn>alignment baseline</dfn>.
	This is the dominant baseline associated with
	the box that generates their <a>shared alignment context</a>
	on the first (last, for ''last-baseline'' alignment) <a title="first formatted line">formatted line</a>.
	For example, in horizontal writing modes,
	specifying ''align-content: baseline'' on table cells in the same row
	will align the alphabetic baselines of their <a>first formatted lines</a>.


<h3 id='distribution-values'>
Distributed Alignment: the ''<content-distribution>/stretch'', ''space-between'', ''space-around'', and ''space-evenly'' keywords</h3>

	The distribution values are used by 'justify-content' and 'align-content'
	to distribute the items in the <a>alignment subject</a>
	evenly between the start and end edges of the <a>alignment container</a>.
	When the <a>alignment subject</a> cannot be distributed in this way,
	they behave as their <dfn export>fallback alignment</dfn>.
	Each distribution value has an associated <<content-position>> as a <a>fallback alignment</a>,
	but one can alternatively be explicitly specified in the property.

	<pre class='prod'> <dfn>&lt;content-distribution></dfn> = space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch</pre>

	<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="<content-distribution>">
		<dt><dfn>space-between</dfn>
		<dd>
			The items are evenly distributed in the <a>alignment container</a>.
			The first item is placed flush with the start edge of the <a>alignment container</a>,
			the last item is placed flush with the end edge of the <a>alignment container</a>,
			and the remaining items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent items is the same.
			Unless otherwise specified,
			this value falls back to ''start''.

		<dt><dfn>space-around</dfn>
		<dd>
			The items are evenly distributed in the <a>alignment container</a>,
			with a half-size space on either end.
			The items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent items is the same,
			and the spacing before the first and after the last item is half the size of the other spacing.
			Unless otherwise specified,
			this value falls back to ''center''.

		<dt><dfn>space-evenly</dfn>
		<dd>
			The items are evenly distributed in the <a>alignment container</a>,
			with a full-size space on either end.
			The items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent items,
			before the first item,
			and after the last item
			is the same.
			Unless otherwise specified,
			this value falls back to ''center''.

		<dt><dfn>stretch</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the combined size of the items is less than the size of the <a>alignment container</a>,
			any ''width/auto''-sized items have their size increased equally so that the combined size exactly fills the <a>alignment container</a>,
			and then clamped by their 'max-width'/'max-height' constraints.

			The items are then aligned as per ''flex-start''.
			<span class='note'>(For layout modes other than flex layout, ''flex-start'' is identical to ''start''.)</span>

<h3 id='overflow-values'>
Overflow Alignment: the ''safe'' and ''true'' keywords</h3>

	When the <a>alignment subject</a> is larger than the <a>alignment container</a>,
	it will overflow.
	Some alignment modes, if honored in this situation,
	may cause data loss:
	for example, if the contents of a sidebar are centered,
	when they overflow they may send part of their boxes past the viewport's start edge,
	which can't be scrolled to.

	To help combat this problem,
	an <dfn export>overflow alignment</dfn> mode can be explicitly specified.
	"True" alignment honors the specified alignment mode in overflow situations, even if it causes data loss,
	while "safe" alignment changes the alignment mode in overflow situations in an attempt to avoid data loss.

	If the <a>overflow alignment</a> isn't explicitly specified,
	the default <a>overflow alignment</a> is determined by the layout mode.
	Document-centric layout modes, such as block layout, default to "safe" <a>overflow alignment</a>,
	while design-centric layout modes, such as flex layout, default to "true" <a>overflow alignment</a>.

	<pre class='prod'><dfn>&lt;overflow-position></dfn> = true | safe</pre>

	<dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="<overflow-position>">
		<dt><dfn>safe</dfn>
		<dd>
			If the size of the <a>alignment subject</a> overflows the <a>alignment container</a>,
			the <a>alignment subject</a> is instead aligned as if the alignment mode were ''start''.

		<dt><dfn>true</dfn>
		<dd>
			Regardless of the relative sizes of the <a>alignment subject</a> and <a>alignment container</a>,
			the given alignment value is honored.

Baseline Content-Alignment</h3>

	The content of boxes participating in row-like layout contexts (<a>shared alignment contexts</a>)
	can be baseline-aligned to each other.
	This effectively increases the padding on the box
	to align the <a>alignment baseline</a> of its contents
	with that of other baseline-aligned boxes in its <a title="baseline-sharing group">group</a>.

	The set of boxes that participate in <dfn export title="baseline content-alignment|first-baseline content-alignment|last-baseline content-alignment">baseline content-alignment</dfn>
	depends on the layout model:

	<dl>
		<dt>Table Cells:

			A <a>table cell</a> participates in first (last) <a>baseline content-alignment</a>
			in either its row or column (whichever matches its <a>inline axis</a>)
			if its computed 'align-content' is ''baseline'' (''last-baseline'').

		<dt>Flex Items:
		<dd>
			A <a>flex item</a> participates in first (last) <a>baseline content-alignment</a>
			in its flex line if
			its computed 'align-content' is ''baseline'' (''last-baseline'')

	within its start-most (end-most) <a>shared alignment context</a> along that axis.

	When a box participates in first (last) <a>baseline content-alignment</a>
	its <a>alignment subject</a> is aligned to the start (end) edge of its <a>alignment container</a>
	and the minimum necessary extra space is added between its start (end) edge and the <a>alignment subject</a>
	to match its <a>alignment baseline</a> in that axis up to that of its <a>baseline-sharing group</a>.
	This increases the intrinsic size of the box.

<h3 id="overflow-scroll-position">
Overflow and Scroll Positions</h3>

	The <a>content distribution properties</a> also affect the initial scroll position,
	setting it to display the appropriate portion of the scrollable area.
	In other words,
	the scrollable area is aligned relative to the viewport
	as specified by the <a>content distribution property</a>.

	<div class='example'>
		For example,
		if a scrollable flex container is set to ''justify-content: flex-end''
		(or ''justify-content: flex-start'' with ''flex-flow: row-reverse''),
		it will be initially displayed scrolled all the way to the main-end edge of the scrollable area,
		and its content will overflow its main-start edge.
	</div>

	Issue: This section is under discussion in the WG.

	Issue: This needs to be integrated with overflow-anchor, when the property exists,
	so that you get the same behavior whether an elements *starts out* overflowing,
	or is filled element-by-element.

		Should we make ''<item-position>/stretch'' actually work on block-level/abspos replaced boxes?

		which has the current behavior of stretching non-replaced boxes and start-aligning replaced ones.

	<div class="example">
		The effect of these rules is that an auto-sized block-level table,
		for example, can be aligned while still having side margins.
		If the table's max-content size is narrower than its containing block,
		then it is shrink-wrapped to that size and aligned as specified.
		If the table's max-content size is wider, then it fills its containing block,
		and the margins provide appropriate spacing from the containing block edges.

Baseline Self-Alignment</h3>

	Boxes participating in row-like layout contexts (<a>shared alignment contexts</a>)
	can be baseline-aligned to each other.
	This effectively increases the margins on the box
	to align its <a>alignment baseline</a>

	The set of boxes that participate in <dfn export title="baseline self-alignment|first-baseline self-alignment|last-baseline self-alignment">baseline self-alignment</dfn>
	depends on the layout model:

	<dl>
		<dt>Flex Items:
		<dd>
			A <a>flex item</a> participates in first (last) <a>baseline self-alignment</a> in its flex line
			if its computed 'align-self' is ''baseline'' (''last-baseline'').
			See [[!CSS3-FLEXBOX]] for details.

		<dt>Grid Items:
		<dd>
			A <a>grid item</a> participates in first (last) <a>baseline content-alignment</a>
			in either its row or column (whichever matches its <a>inline axis</a>)
			if its 'justify-self' or 'align-self' property (whichever matches its <a>inline axis</a>)

Determining the Baseline of a Box</h2>

	The <dfn export title="first baselines|baselines of a box">first baselines</dfn> (and <dfn export>last baselines</dfn>) of a box
	for a given axis
	are a set of baselines (alphabetic, central, etc.)
	nominally associated with the first (last) line of text within the box.
	The <a>alignment baseline</a> is one of these,
	usually the dominant baseline of the <a>alignment container</a>.
	(See 'alignment-baseline'.)
	Note that boxes might not have baselines in a particular axis.

	The first and last <a>baselines of a box</a>
	are determined differently based on the layout model, as follows:

	<dl>
		<dt>block containers
		<dd>
			The first (last) inline-axis baselines of a block container
			are <a>generated</a> from the dominant first (last) baseline of the first (last) in-flow line box in the block container,
			or are taken from the first (last) in-flow block-level child in the block container that contributes a set of first (last) baselines,
			whichever comes first (last).
			If there is no such line box or child,
			then the block container has no baselines.
			For the purposes of finding the baselines,
			in-flow boxes with a scrolling mechanisms (see the 'overflow' property)
			must be considered as if scrolled to their origin (final) position.

			A block container has no block-axis baselines.

		<dt>tables
		<dd>
			The first (last) inline-axis baselines of a table box are
			the first (last) baselines of its first (last) row.

			When finding the baselines of an inline-block,
			any baselines contributed by table boxes must be skipped.
			(This quirk is a legacy behavior from [[CSS21]].)

			The first (last) block-axis baselines of a table box are the first (last) baselines of its first (last) column.

		<dt>table rows
		<dd>
			If any cells in the row participate in ''baseline'' (''last-baseline'') alignment along the row axis,
			the first (last) inline-axis baselines of the row
			are <a>generated</a> from their shared <a>alignment baseline</a>
			and the row's <a>first available font</a>,
			after alignment has been performed.
			Otherwise, the first (last) inline-axis baselines of the row
			are <a>synthesized</a> from the lowest and highest content edges of the cells in the row.
			[[!CSS21]]

			A table row has no block-axis baselines.

		<dt>table columns
		<dd>
			If any cells in the column participate in ''baseline'' (''last-baseline'') alignment
			along the column axis (by having a writing mode perpendicular to that of the table),
			the first (last) block-axis baselines of the column
			are <a>generated</a> from their shared <a>alignment baseline</a>
			and the column's <a>first available font</a>,
			after alignment has been performed.
			Otherwise, the the first (last) inline-axis baselines of the row
			are <a>synthesized</a> from the extreme content edges of the cells in the row.
			[[!CSS21]]

			A table column has no inline-axis baselines.

	To <dfn local-title=generate|generated>generate baselines</dfn> for a box from a single baseline,
	use the baseline table from the font settings and <a>first available font</a> of that box.

	To <dfn local-title=synthesize|synthesized>synthesize baselines</dfn> from a rectangle (or two parallel lines),

	Note: The forthcoming Inline Layout Module will define synthesis rules for baselines other than alphabetic and central.
