Abstract</h2>

  <p>
    This module describes the fragmentation model that partitions a flow into pages.
    It builds on the Page model module and introduces and defines the fragmentation
    model. It adds functionality for pagination, breaking variable fragment size and
    orientation, widows and orphans.

Introduction</h2>

  <p><em>This section is not normative.</em></p>
  <p>
    In paged media (e.g., paper, transparencies, photo album pages, pages
    displayed on computer screens as printed output simulations), as
    opposed to <a href="/TR/CSS2/media.html#continuous-media-group">
    continuous media</a>, the content of the document is split into one or
    more discrete display surfaces. In order to avoid awkward breaks
    (such as halfway through a line of text), the layout engine must be
    able to shift around content that would fall across the page break.
    This process is called <dfn>pagination</dfn>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In CSS, in addition to paged media, certain layout features such as
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions/">regions</a> [[CSS3-REGIONS]]
    and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">multi-column layout</a>
    [[CSS3COL]] create a similarly fragmented environment.
    The generic term for breaking content across containers is
    <dfn>fragmentation</dfn>.
    This module explains how content breaks across <i>fragmentation containers</i>
    such as pages and columns and how such breaks can be
    <a href="#breaking-controls">controlled by the author</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="placement">
Module Interactions</h3>

  <p>
    This module replaces and extends the pagination controls defined in
    [[CSS21]] <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html#page-breaks">section 13.3</a>
    and in [[CSS3PAGE]].
  </p>
  <!-- End section "Modules Interactions" -->

<h3 id="values">
Values</h3>

  <p>
    This specification follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">
    CSS property definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined
    in this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]]. Other CSS
    modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for example [[CSS3COLOR]],
    when combined with this module, expands the definition of the &lt;color&gt; value
    type as used in this specification.</p>
  <p>
    In addition to the property-specific values listed in their definitions, all properties
    defined in this specification also accept the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cascade.html#value-def-inherit">
    inherit</a> keyword as their property value. For readability it has not been
    repeated explicitly.
  </p>

<h2 id="fragmentation-model">
Fragmentation Model and Terminology</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><dfn>fragmented flow</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A content flow that is being laid out in a <i>fragmentation context</i>,
      such as a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/">multi-column element</a>,
      a chain of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-regions">CSS regions</a>,
      or a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/">paged media display</a>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmenter</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A box&mdash;such as a page box, column box, or region&mdash;that contains
      a portion (or all) of a <i>fragmented flow</i>.
      Fragmenters can be pre-defined, or generated as needed.
      When breakable content overflows a fragmenter in the block dimension,
      instead of overflowing it breaks into the next container in its
      <i>fragmentation context</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmentation context</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      An ordered series of <i>fragmenters</i>.
      A given fragmentation context can only have one block flow direction
      across all its fragmenters.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>fragmentation</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The process of splitting a content flow across the <i>fragmenters</i>
      that form a <i>fragmentation context</i>.
    </dd>
    <dt><dfn>box fragment</dfn> or <dfn>fragment</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      The portion of a box that belongs to exactly one <i>fragmenter</i>.
      A box in continuous flow always consists of only one fragment.
      A box in a fragmented flow consists of one or more fragments.
  </dl>

  <p>
    Each <dfn>fragmentation break</dfn> (hereafter, <dfn>break</dfn>) ends
    layout in the current <i>fragmenter</i> and causes the remaining content
    of the fragmented flow to be laid out in the next
    <i>fragmentation container</i>.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    Breaking inline content into lines is another form of fragmentation,
    and similarly creates box fragments when it breaks
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html#inline-boxes">inline boxes</a>.
    However, inline breaking is not covered here; see [[CSS3TEXT]] and
    the 'box-decoration-break' property in [[CSS3BACKGROUND]].
  </p>

<h2 id="breaking-controls">
Breaking Controls</h2>

  <p>
    The following sections explain how breaks are controlled in a fragmented
    flow. Five properties indicate where the user agent may or should break
    the content flow. In the case of pagination, the author can also specify
    on which page (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/#left-right-first">left or right</a>)
    the subsequent content should resume.
  </p>

  <p>
    A potential page/column/region break location is typically under the influence of
    the parent element's 'break-inside' property, the 'break-after' property of the
    preceding element, and the 'break-before' property of the following element. When
    these properties have values other than ''auto'', the forced break values (''always'',
    ''left'', ''right'', ''page'', ''column'' and ''region'') take precedence over the
    values (''avoid-page'', ''avoid-column'' and ''avoid-region''). See the section
    on <a href="#breaking-rules">rules for breaking</a> for the exact rules on how these
    properties affect forced breaks.
  </p>
  <p>
    User Agents must apply these properties to block-level boxes and to table rows,
    table row groups, and&#8212;in the case of 'break-inside'&#8212;block containers
    in the normal flow of the root element. User agents should also apply these properties
    to floated boxes whose containing block is in the normal flow of the root element.
    User agents may also apply these properties to other boxes.

  <p>
    The 'orphans' property specifies the minimum number of line boxes in a block container
    that must be left at the end of a <i>fragment</i>, unless this is the last <i>fragment</i>
    of the box. The 'widows' property specifies the minimum number of line boxes of
    a block container that must be left at the start of a <i>fragment</i>, unless this
    is the last <i>fragment</i> of the box. Examples of how they are used to control
    <i>fragmenter</i> breaks are given below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only positive integers are allowed as values of 'orphans' and 'widows'. Negative
    values and zero are invalid must cause the declaration to be
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">ignored</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a block contains fewer lines than the value of 'widows' or 'orphans', the rule
    simply becomes that all lines in the block must be kept together.
  </p>

<h2 id="breaking-rules">
Rules for Breaking</h2>

  <p>
    When a break splits a box, the box's bottom margins, borders, and padding have
    no visual effect where the split occurs; the box's background and left and right
    margins, border, and padding extend to the bottom of the page, through an ensuing
    blank page if one exists, and onto the top of the subsequent page.
  </p>

<h3 id="allowed-pg-brk">
Allowed page breaks</h3>

  <p>In the normal flow, page breaks may occur at the following places:</p>

  <ol>
    <li id="brk-btw-blocks">
      In the vertical margin between sibling block boxes (or rows
      in a table). When an unforced page break occurs here, both the adjoining 'margin-top'
      and 'margin-bottom' are set to zero.
    </li>
    <li id="brk-btw-lines">Between line boxes inside a block box.</li>
    <li id="brk-end-block">
      Between the content edge of a block box and the outer edges of
      its child content (margin edges of block-level children or line box edges for inline-level
      children) <em>if</em> there is a (non-zero) gap between them.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>These breaks are subject to the following rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Rule A:</strong> Breaking at <a href="#brk-btw-blocks">(1)</a> is allowed
      only if the 'page-break-after' and 'page-break-before' properties of all the elements
      generating boxes that meet at this margin allow it, which is when at least one of
      them has the value ''always'', ''left'',
      or ''right'', or when all of them are ''auto''.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rule B:</strong> However, if all of them are ''auto''
      and a common ancestor of all the elements has a 'page-break-inside'
      value of ''avoid'', then breaking here is not allowed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rule C:</strong> Breaking at <a href="#brk-btw-lines">(2)</a> is allowed
      only if the number of line boxes between the break and the start of the enclosing
      block box is the value of 'orphans' or more, and the number of line boxes between
      the break and the end of the box is the value of 'widows' or more.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rule D:</strong> In addition, breaking at <a href="#brk-btw-blocks">(2)</a>
      or <a href="#brk-end-block">(3)</a> is allowed only if the 'page-break-inside' property
      of all ancestors is ''auto''.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If the above doesn't provide enough break points to keep content from overflowing
    the page boxes, then rules A, B and D are dropped in order to find additional breakpoints.
    In this case the UA may use the 'avoid's that are in effect at those points to weigh
    the appropriateness of the new breakpoints; however, this specification does not
    suggest a precise algorithm.
  </p>
  <p>
    If that still does not lead to sufficient break points, rule C is dropped as well,
    to find still more break points.
  </p>

<h3 id="forced-pg-brk">
Forced page breaks</h3>

  <p>
    A page break must occur at <a href="#brk-btw-blocks">(1)</a>
    if, among the'page-break-after' and 'page-break-before' properties of all the elements
    generating boxes that meet at this margin, there is at least one with the value
      ''always'', ''left'', or
      ''right''.
  </p>
  <p>
    When multiple 'page-break-before' and/or 'page-break-after' properties with values
    of "always", "left" or "right" apply at a margin, only one of them should generate
    page breaks. That is, no content-empty pages are generated by page-break properties,
    except for at most one content-empty page as may be required by 'right' and 'left'
    values to position ensuing content on a right- or left-facing page.
  </p>
  <p>
    A page break must also occur at <a href="#brk-btw-blocks">(1)</a>
    if the last line box above this margin and the first one below it do not have the
    same value for 'page'.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a forced page break occurs at <a href="#brk-btw-blocks">(1)</a>, the used values
    of any adjoining 'margin-bottom' are set to zero.
  </p>

<h3 id="best-pg-brk">
"Best" page breaks</h3>

  <p>
    CSS3 does <em>not</em> define which of a set of allowed page breaks must
    be used; except as defined earlier in the section, CSS3 does not forbid
    a user agent to break at every possible break point, or to not break at all. But
    CSS3 does recommend that user agents observe the following guidelines (while recognizing
    that they are sometimes contradictory):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Break as few times as possible.</li>
    <li>Make all pages that don't end with a forced break appear to have about the same height.</li>
    <li>Avoid breaking inside a replaced element.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <p>
      Suppose, for example, that the style sheet contains ''orphans : 4'',
      ''widows : 2'', and there are 20 lines (line boxes) available
      at the bottom of the current page, and the next block in normal flow is considered
      for placement:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the block contains 20 line boxes or fewer, it should
        be placed on the current page.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the block contains 21 or 22 line boxes, the second part of the paragrap
        must not violate the 'widows'
        constraint, and so the second part must contain at least
        two line boxes; likewise the first part must contain at
        least four line boxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the block contains 23 line boxes or more, the first part should contain
        20 lines and the second part the remaining lines. (But if any
        part of the block is placed on the current page, that part must
        contain at least four line boxes and the second part at least two line boxes.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now suppose that 'orphans' is ''10'',
      'widows' is ''20'', and there
      are 8 lines available at the bottom of the current page:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the block contains 8 lines or fewer, it should be placed
        on the current page.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the block contains 9 lines or more, it may NOT be split
        (that would violate the orphan constraint), so it must
        move as a block to the next page.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3 id="conformance-classes">Conformance Classes</h3>
  <p>Conformance to CSS Fragmentation is defined for three conformance classes:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt><dfn title="style sheet!!as conformance class">style sheet</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#style-sheet">CSS style sheet</a>.</dd>
    <dt><dfn>renderer</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a> that interprets
      the semantics of a style sheet and renders documents that use them.</dd>
    <dt><dfn id="authoring-tool">authoring tool</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#user-agent">UA</a> that writes
      a style sheet.</dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    A style sheet is conformant to CSS Fragmentation if all of its declarations
    that use properties defined in this module have values that are valid according
    to the generic CSS grammar and the individual grammars of each property as given
    in this module.
  </p>
  <p>
    A renderer is conformant to CSS Fragmentation if, in addition to interpreting
    the style sheet as defined by the appropriate specifications, it supports all the
    features defined by CSS Fragmentation by parsing them correctly and rendering
    the document accordingly. However, the inability of a UA to correctly render a document
    due to limitations of the device does not make the UA non-conformant. (For example,
    a UA is not required to render color on a monochrome monitor.)
  </p>
  <p>
    An authoring tool is conformant to CSS Fragmentation if it writes style
    sheets that are syntactically correct according to the generic CSS grammar and the
    individual grammars of each feature in this module, and meet all other conformance
    requirements of style sheets as described in this module.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="partial">
Partial Implementations</h3>

  <p>
    So that authors can exploit the forward-compatible parsing rules to assign fallback
    values, CSS renderers <strong>must</strong> treat as invalid (and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#ignore">
        ignore as appropriate</a>) any at-rules, properties, property values, keywords,
    and other syntactic constructs for which they have no usable level of support. In
    particular, user agents <strong>must not</strong> selectively ignore unsupported
    component values and honor supported values in a single multi-value property declaration:
    if any value is considered invalid (as unsupported values must be), CSS requires
    that the entire declaration be ignored.
  </p>

<h3 id="experimental">
Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>
    To avoid clashes with future CSS features, the CSS2.1 specification reserves a <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#vendor-keywords">prefixed syntax</a>
    for proprietary and experimental extensions to CSS.</p>
  <p>
    Prior to a specification reaching the Candidate Recommendation stage in the W3C
    process, all implementations of a CSS feature are considered experimental. The CSS
    Working Group recommends that implementations use a vendor-prefixed syntax for such
    features, including those in W3C Working Drafts. This avoids incompatibilities with
    future changes in the draft.
  </p>

<h3 id="testing">
Non-Experimental Implementations</h3>

  <p>
    Once a specification reaches the Candidate Recommendation stage, non-experimental
    implementations are possible, and implementors should release an unprefixed implementation
    of any CR-level feature they can demonstrate to be correctly implemented according
    to spec.
  </p>
  <p>
    To establish and maintain the interoperability of CSS across implementations, the
    CSS Working Group requests that non-experimental CSS renderers submit an implementation
    report (and, if necessary, the testcases used for that implementation report) to
    the W3C before releasing an unprefixed implementation of any CSS features. Testcases
    submitted to W3C are subject to review and correction by the CSS Working Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further information on submitting testcases and implementation reports can be found
    from on the CSS Working Group's website at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/">
        http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/</a>. Questions should be directed to the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-css-testsuite">
            public-css-testsuite@w3.org</a> mailing list.
  </p>
  
<h3 id="cr-exit-criteria">
CR Exit Criteria</h3>

  <p>
    For this specification to be advanced to Proposed Recommendation, there must be
    at least two independent, interoperable implementations of each feature. Each feature
    may be implemented by a different set of products, there is no requirement that
    all features be implemented by a single product. For the purposes of this criterion,
    we define the following terms:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>independent </dt>
    <dd>
      each implementation must be developed by a different party and cannot share, reuse,
      or derive from code used by another qualifying implementation. Sections of code
      that have no bearing on the implementation of this specification are exempt from
      this requirement.</dd>
    <dt>interoperable</dt>
    <dd>
      passing the respective test case(s) in the official CSS test suite, or, if the implementation
      is not a Web browser, an equivalent test. Every relevant test in the test suite
      should have an equivalent test created if such a user agent (UA) is to be used to
      claim interoperability. In addition if such a UA is to be used to claim interoperability,
      then there must one or more additional UAs which can also pass those equivalent
      tests in the same way for the purpose of interoperability. The equivalent tests
      must be made publicly available for the purposes of peer review.
    </dd>
    <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>
      a user agent which:
      <ol class="inline">
      <li>implements the specification.</li>
      <li>is available to the general public. The implementation may be a shipping product
        or other publicly available version (i.e., beta version, preview release, or “nightly
        build”). Non-shipping product releases must have implemented the feature(s) for
        a period of at least one month in order to demonstrate stability.</li>
      <li>is not experimental (i.e., a version specifically designed to pass the test suite
        and is not intended for normal usage going forward).</li>
      </ol>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    The specification will remain Candidate Recommendation for at least six months.
