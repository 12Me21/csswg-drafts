- Make single-* productions
  introduced earlier today have hyperlinks and better ids.

- Fix error I just introduced not fixing up prose
  copied from transitions, and also fix another similar, preexisting
  error.

- Make it clear that the comma-
  separated items in the transition and animation shorthands don't
  themselves contain comma-separated items (which, if you read the
  grammar literally, they did). Fixes issue raised in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Sep/0375.html .

- Add Percentages: lines and incorrectly reorder
  Computed Value: and Animatable: lines to make the preprocessor
  happy.

- Keyframe rule declarations marked with !important are ignored (Bug
  14792)

- Update property syntax defs: reintroduce comma separators, fix *
  wildcards (were converted to #)

- Make negative transition-duration and animation-duration values
  invalid (Bug 16806)

2012-06-28  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Fix the definition of 'animation-fill-mode' as described in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Jun/0447.html .

   1. account for 'reverse' and 'alternate-reverse' animation
  directions

   2. account for the possibility that 'animation-iteration-count' is
  not an integer

- Untabify the <pre> elements and regenerate so that we end up with
  pretty much the same result as before.

2012-06-19  Sylvain Galineau  <sylvaing@microsoft.com>
- Fix typo in section 3 (missing 'a')

2012-05-30  Tab Atkins Jr.  <jackalmage@gmail.com>

  iteration

- Editorial changes for bugs 14784 and 14778

2012-04-04  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>
- Fixed a mark-up error (id="id=timing..."). Added missing slash after
  this-version URL.

2012-04-03  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Copy clearer wording on list repetition from css3-transitions (which
  was in turn partly taken from css3-background).

- Update 'Previous Version' links to reflect today's publication as
  WD.

2012-03-29  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Make the new ids better by not starting them with 'the'.

- Make better ids, and add a elements with the old ids for backwards
  compatibility (but no new links).

- Reduce redirects found by the link checker.

- Remove BOM and add meta-charset.

- Fix source-only validation error and corresponding incorrect
  indentation.

- Even more pairs of [] are needed for the grammar to be correct.

  Thanks to Tab for pointing this out in
  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2012Mar/0679.html .

2012-03-28  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Add two additional values for animation-direction: reverse and
  alternate-reverse .

  This is as proposed in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2011May/0548.html and resolved in the group's 2012 March 28
  teleconference per http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-
  style/2012Mar/0655.html

- Fix two errors in the grammar of the steps() function: first, add
  necessary [] so that the comma applies to both the start and end
  values; second, add the ? that was intended to indicate the second
  parameter being optional.

- Add necessary []s to grammar: since juxtaposition binds tighter
  than |, [] are needed so that the comma needs to separate all the
  items in the list (rather than requiring a comma to separate values
  only for the first of the options).

- Use underscores instead of hyphens in grammar production names since
  hyphens are not valid in Yacc identifiers.

2012-03-27  L. David Baron  <dbaron@dbaron.org>
- Add 'Discussion:' line to spec header.

  that productions allow whitespace at their end but not their start.

- Fix sylvaing email address; resolve bug 14782

- Zero times now have the unit specifier (dbaron feedback 11 April)

2011-04-05 dino@apple.com

Changes from David Baron's feedback

- describe that animationstart event fires after delay has expired
  either with a zero elapsedTime (in the case where delay >= 0) or
  -1 * delay (in the case where delay < 0)
- if the same property is animated in multiple animations, then the
  animation-name closest to the end of the list wins.
- animation-name is the dominant property for lists. Every other property
  repeats to fill whatever animation-name requires.
- insertRule is now appendRule (always appends, does not replace)
- describe that animations with a 0 duration still respect fill mode, delay
  and fire events.

2011-03-21 simon.fraser@apple.com

 - Removed "Module Level 3" from the title.

2011-01-20 simon.fraser@apple.com

- copy prose from transitions related to disambiguation of animation-duration
and animation-delay in the shorthand.

2010-08-19 dino@apple.com

- add animation-fill-mode property
- list stepped timing functions

2010-03-23 simon.fraser@apple.com

- Better start to the Keyframes section
- Example 1 changed to use an identifier, rather than a string for the keyframes name.
- Changed paragraph stating that 'from' and 'to' keyframes are required to say that these
  are implied if missing, using the computed values. Added ISSUE related to repeating animations.
- Added NOTE to clarify behavior when a property is not specified in all keyframes.
- Move the contents Animation Behavior section into the Animation section, so we introduce general
animation behavior before diving into keyframes.

2010-03-10 simon.fraser@apple.com

- enhance the Abstract and Introduction.

2010-03-10  cmarrin  <cmarrin>
- Minor clarifying edits and removed the issue that we are thinking of
  removing play-state. By popular demand it is staying in

2009-04-14  Bert Bos  <bert@w3.org>

2009-02-10  Dean Jackson  <dino@apple.com>
