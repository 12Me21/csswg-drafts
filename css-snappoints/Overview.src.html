<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

    <em>This section is not normative.</em>

    Popular UX paradigms for scrollable content frequently employ paging through content,
    or sectioning into logical divisions.
    This is especially true for touch interactions
    where it is quicker and easier for users to quickly pan through a flatly-arranged breadth of content
    rather than delving into a heirarchical structure through tap navigation.
    For example, it is easier for a user to view many photos in a photo album
    by panning through a photo slideshow view
    rather than tapping on individual photos in an album.

    However, given the imprecise nature of scrolling inputs
    like touch panning and mousewheel scrolling,
    it is difficult for web developers to guarantee a well-controlled scrolling experience,
    in particular creating the effect of paging through content.
    For instance, it is easy for a user to land at an awkward scroll offset
    which leaves a page partially on-screen when panning.

    To this end, we introduce scroll snap points
    which enforce the scroll offsets that a <a>scroll container's</a> visual viewport may end at
    after a scrolling operation has completed.

<h3 id="placement">Module interactions</h3>

    This module extends the scrolling user interface features defined in [[!CSS21]] section 11.1.

    None of the properties in this module apply to the ''::first-line'' and ''::first-letter'' pseudo-elements.

<h3 id="values">Values</h3>

    This specification follows the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/about.html#property-defs">CSS property
    definition conventions</a> from [[!CSS21]]. Value types not defined in
    this specification are defined in CSS Level 2 Revision 1 [[!CSS21]].
    Other CSS modules may expand the definitions of these value types: for
    example [[CSS3VAL]], when combined with this module, expands the
    definition of the <<length>> value type as used in this specification.

<h2 id="examples">Motivating Examples</h2>

    <div class="example">
        In this example, a series of images arranged in a <a>scroll container</a>
        are used to build a photo gallery.  In this example the <a>scroll container</a>
        is larger than the photos contained within (such that multiple images may be seen simultaneously), and the image
        sizes vary.  Using mandatory element-based snap
        points, scrolling will always complete with an image centered in the <a>scroll container's</a> visual viewport.

        <pre>
            img {
                /* Defines the center of each photo as the
                   coordinate that should be used for snapping */
                scroll-snap-coordinate: 50% 50%;
            }
            .photoGallery {
                width: 500px;
                overflow-x: auto;
                overflow-y: hidden;
                white-space: nowrap;
                /* Specifies that each element's snap coordinate should
                   align with the center of the scroll container */
                scroll-snap-destination: 50% 50%;
                /* Requires that scrolling always end at a snap point
                   when the operation completes. */
                scroll-snap-type: mandatory;
            }
        </pre>

        <pre>
            &lt;div class="photoGallery">
                &lt;img src="img1.jpg">

                (represented by a red X),

                (represented by yellow plus signs).
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        This example builds a paginated document that aligns each page near to (but not exactly on) the edge of the <a>scroll container</a>.
        This allows the previous page to "peek" in from above in order to make the user aware that they are not yet at the top of the document.
        Using proximity snap points instead of mandatory snap points allows the user to stop halfway through a page (rather than forcing them
        to snap one page at a time).  However, if a scrolling operation would finish near a snap point, then the scroll will be adjusted to
        align the page as specified.

        <pre>
            .page {
                /* Defines the top center of each page as the
                   coordinate that should be used for snapping */
                scroll-snap-coordinate: 50% 0;
            }
            .docScroller {

                   align with the center of the scroll container, offset

                 /* Encourages scrolling to end at a snap point when the

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    This module introduces control over <a>scroll snap positions</a>,
    which are scroll positions that produce particular alignments
    of content within a scrollable viewport.
    Using the 'scroll-snap-type' propoperty on the relevant <a>scroll container</a>,
    the author can request a particular bias
    for the viewport to land on a valid <a>snap position</a>
    during scrolling operations.

    Valid <a>snap positions</a> can be specified
    as a particular alignment ('scroll-snap-align')
    of an element's <a>scroll snap area</a> ('scroll-snap-area', defaulting to its margin box)
    within the <a>scroll container</a>â€™s <a>snap viewport</a>
    (its viewport, as reduced by 'scroll-snap-padding').
    This is conceptually equivalent to specifying the alignment of
    an <a>alignment subject</a> within an <a>alignment container</a>.
    The scroll position that satisfies the specified alignment
    is a valid <a>snap position</a>.

    <a>Snap positions</a> must only affect the nearest ancestor
    (on the element's <a>containing block chain</a>)
    <a>scroll container</a>.

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt><dfn export>scroll container</dfn>
        <dd>
            An element which provides a scrolling user interface as described in [[!CSS21]], particularly in the section on overflow.

        <dt><dfn export>snap position</dfn>
        <dd>
            For a scroll container, a particular value for its scroll offset is a snap position if when scrolled to that offset the visual viewport of the scroll container would align with a descendent element in the manner specified by the scroll snap properties.
    </dl>

<h2 id="scroll-snap-type">Scroll Snap Types: the 'scroll-snap-type' property</h2>

    The ''scroll-snap-type'' property defines how strictly a <a>scroll container's</a> visual viewport should rest on <a>snap positions</a>.  It intentionally does not specify nor mandate any precise animations or physics used to enforce those snap points; this is left up to the user agent.

    <pre class='propdef'>
    Name: scroll-snap-type
    Value: none | mandatory | proximity
    Initial: none
    Applies to: all elements
    Inherited: no
    Percentages: n/a
    Media: interactive
    Computed value: specified value
    Animatable: no
    </pre>

    <dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="scroll-snap-type">
        <dt><dfn>none</dfn>
        <dd>
            The visual viewport of this <a>scroll container</a> must ignore snap positions.

        <dt><dfn>mandatory</dfn>
        <dd>
            The visual viewport of this <a>scroll container</a> is guaranteed to rest on a snap position when there are no active scrolling operations.  That is, it must come to rest on a snap position at the termination of a scroll, if a valid, reachable snap position exists.  If no valid, reachable snap position exists then no snapping occurs.  If the content changes such that the visual viewport would no longer rest on a snap position (e.g. content is added, moved, deleted, resized), the scroll offset must be modified to maintain this guarantee.

        <dt><dfn>proximity</dfn>
        <dd>
            The visual viewport of this <a>scroll container</a> may come to rest on a snap position at the termination of a scroll at the discretion of the UA given the parameters of the scroll.  If the content changes such that the visual viewport would no longer rest on a snap position (e.g. content is added, moved, deleted, resized), the scroll offset may be modified to maintain this guarantee.
    </dl>

<h2 id="scroll-snap-padding">Scroll Snap Padding: the 'scroll-snap-padding' property</h2>

    The 'scroll-snap-padding' property defines a region inset from the visual viewport of a <a>scroll container</a> used in calculating its <a>snap positions</a>.

    <pre class="propdef">
    Name: scroll-snap-padding
    Value: <<length>>{1,4}
    Initial: 0
    Applies to: scroll containers
    Inherited: no
    Percentages: relative to the scroll container's visual viewport
    Media: interactive
    Computed value: specified value, with lengths made absolute
    Animatable: yes
    </pre>

    <dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="scroll-snap-padding">
        <dt><dfn><<length>>{1,4}</dfn>
        <dd>
            Specifies the region inset from the visual viewport.  Values are interpreted as for 'padding', and specify inward offsets from each edge of the visual viewport.
    </dl>

<h2 id="scroll-snap-area">Scroll Snap Area: the 'scroll-snap-area' property</h2>

    The 'scroll-snap-area' property defines a region for an element used in calculating <a>snap positions</a> for its ancestor scroll container.

    <pre class="propdef">
    Name: scroll-snap-area
    Value: [ border-box | margin-box ]? <<length>>{1,4}
    Initial: 0
    Applies to: all elements
    Inherited: no
    Percentages: relative to the specified element box
    Media: interactive
    Computed value: specified value, with lengths made absolute
    Animatable: yes
    </pre>

    <dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="scroll-snap-area">
        <dt><dfn>[ border-box | margin-box ]? <<length>>{1,4}</dfn>
        <dd>
            Specifies the outset of the element's snap area from the axis-aligned bounding box of the transformed specified box, in the <a>scroll container's</a> coordinate space.  Outsets are applied to this bounding box, not the specified box.  If the box argument is omitted it defaults to border-box.

            Note: This ensures that the scroll snap area is always rectangular and axis-aligned to the <a>scroll container's</a> coordinate space.
    </dl>

<h2 id="scroll-snap-align">Scroll Snap Align: the 'scroll-snap-align' property</h2>

    The 'scroll-snap-align' property specifies how a scroll container's region specified by 'scroll-snap-padding' should align with descendent elements' scroll snap area.  The two values specify the snapping behavior in the x and y axes, respectively.  If only one value is specified, the second value defaults to the same value.

    <p class="issue">
        Should this be x/y axes, or inline/block?  Starting with x/y axes for consistency with padding/area, otherwise a writing mode change would result in a axis mismatch (since padding is physical by default).
    </p>

    <pre class="propdef">
    Name: scroll-snap-align
    Value: [ none | start | end | center ]{1,2}
    Initial: none
    Applies to: all elements
    Inherited: no
    Percentages: n/a
    Media: interactive
    Computed value: two keywords
    Animatable: no
    </pre>

    <dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="scroll-snap-align">
        <dt><dfn>none</dfn>
        <dd>
            This box does not define a <a>snap position</a> in the specified axis.

        <dt><dfn>start</dfn>
        <dd>
            The scroll offset which aligns the start edge of this box's scroll snap area with the start edge of its ancestor scroll container's region defined by 'scroll-snap-padding' in the specified axis is a <a>snap position</a> in that axis.

        <dt><dfn>end</dfn>
        <dd>
            The scroll offset which aligns the end edge of this box's scroll snap area with the end edge of its ancestor scroll container's region defined by 'scroll-snap-padding' in the specified axis is a <a>snap position</a> in that axis.

        <dt><dfn>center</dfn>
        <dd>
            The scroll offset which aligns the center of this box's scroll snap area with the center of its ancestor scroll container's region defined by 'scroll-snap-padding' in the specified axis is a <a>snap position</a> in that axis.
    </dl>

<h2 id="scroll-snap-destination">Scroll Snap Destination: the 'scroll-snap-destination' property</h2>

    The 'scroll-snap-destination' property is used to define the x and y coordinate within the <a>scroll container's</a> visual viewport
    which element snap points will align with.

    <pre class="propdef">
    Name: scroll-snap-destination
    Value: <<position>>
    Initial: 0px 0px
    Applies to: <a>scroll containers</a>
    Inherited: no
    Percentages: relative to width and height of the padding-box of the <a>scroll container</a>
    Media: interactive
    Computed value: specified value, with lengths made absolute
    Animatable: yes
    </pre>

    <dl dfn-type="value" dfn-for="scroll-snap-destination">
        <dt><dfn><<position>></dfn>
        <dd>
            Specifies the offset of the snap destination from the start edge of the <a>scroll container's</a> visual viewport.  The first value gives the x coordinate of the snap destination, the second value its y coordinate.
    </dl>

<h2 id="scroll-snap-coordinate">Scroll Snap Coordinate: the 'scroll-snap-coordinate' property</h2>

    The 'scroll-snap-coordinate' property is used to define a coordinate within an element.  This coordinate is then associated with the nearest ancestor element which is a <a>scroll container</a> or has a scroll-snap-type that is not "none".  If it is associated with a <a>scroll container</a>, then that <a>scroll container</a> is considered to be snapped to that element if its scroll offset is such that the coordinate and destination are aligned.  In the case that the element has been transformed, the snap coordinate is also transformed in the same way (such that the snap-point is aligned with the element as-drawn).

    <p class="issue">
        Consider alternative naming besides "coordinate".  Consider naming conventions like in Grid Layout for grouping properties on the container vs. items.
    </p>

    <pre class="propdef">
    Name: scroll-snap-coordinate
    Value: none | [ border-box | margin-box ]? <<position>>
    Initial: none
    Applies to: all elements
    Inherited: no
    Percentages: refer to the specified element box
    Media: interactive
    Computed value: specified value, with lengths made absolute
    Animatable: yes
    </pre>

    <dl dfn-type=value dfn-for="scroll-snap-coordinate">
        <dt><dfn>none</dfn>
        <dd>
            Specifies that this element does not contribute a snap point.

        <dt><dfn>[ border-box | margin-box ]? <<position>></dfn>
        <dd>
            Specifies the offset of the snap coordinate from the start edge of the element's specified box.  If the box argument is omitted it defaults to border-box.
    </dl>
